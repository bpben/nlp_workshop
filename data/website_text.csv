Introducing Natural Beaded Rows NBR Extensions create a beautiful mane with incredible manageability and the freedom to totally customize your look. NBR utilizes rows of hair that wrap around the head in a horseshoe shape. It's attached by first anchoring a row of thread and beads into the hair, then stitching the extension hair to the thread. Typically, an NBR application is made up of between one and three rows of hair, and the whole process takes between two to three and a half hours from start to finish. NBR is the one of the safest methods of adding hair extensions on the market. The process is chemical free, tape free, bond free, and braid free.

Molecular Fitness Member Read more success stories here… Train your body to burn fat As a result of genetics, some people will experience greater benefits with certain types of exercises. These genetic variants affect how fat is transported in the blood and where fat is stored for muscles to use as energy. Find out if your genotype is associated with increased fat loss and increased muscle mass with resistance training. In this case, fat is more likely to be stored inside the muscle (intramuscularly) rather than under the skin (subcutaneously) as with other genotypes. This allows your muscles to more easily utilize the fat for energy as well as gives the appearance of more toned muscles in response to training.

Therapy helps people live fuller lives and obtain more useful tools for living a better life. Psychotherapy is for people who need to adjust, install and immerse in a different world and culture and start all over again. When You Need It Think of therapy as a tool. Once you have it, you can access it wherever and whenever you need it. You have the power to make things happen in your life and my role is to help provide clarity for you to get there. “What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality” – Plutarch My Role I have more than 30 years of experience, and during that time I have seen incredible changes and emotional growth in people who embark in the adventure called Psychoanalytical therapy. It is a voyage to their inner selves with the intention of getting to know and understand themselves. I love every part of therapy, especially being a guide for you on your journey through life. Therapy as a Tool Therapy is for everyone. Not only for people that suffer from anxiety and depression, from panic attacks and phobias, or people that get easily stuck in fixated ideas and suffer because of it. For those who feel an emptiness inside of themselves, yet may express no symptoms. Therapy is also beneficial for people living through situations in their lives that need to be processed, important changes such as going to college, getting married, becoming pregnant, migration and life transitions. The learning you gain from therapy will accompany you always. Gaining Clarity In this day and age everything is going by so quickly. New technologies emerge all the time and obsolescence is built in everywhere. Technologies are built to crash and fail. It’s important to acknowledge that we all need some peace and quiet in our lives and therapy is a mechanism to do that – to find clarity, take a moment to think about yourself, to breath, to be peaceful, and to move forward. It is not for “crazy people”. It is a part of leading a happy life.

Renovated and redesigned out of love and a clear vision to add a new style to bicycle retail, Superb has developed a national and international audience. While departing from our storefront at 842 Beacon St, we will continue the concept as Superb returns home to where it began at 259 Mass Ave Cambridge: the home of Cambridge Bicycle. Here our provisions and staff will unite under one roof to offer an even greater customer experience. We hope to see you there and thank you for helping us progress the culture of cycling. — Superb Bicycle and Cambridge Bicycle comments closed We knew it was going to happen, and it finally did. November 11, 2016 The cold weather is teasing us now. Soon there will be snow on our streets, hot coco in our hands and snow, did we mention snow? That can only mean one thing… It’s time to get your winter riding gear in order! And we at Superb can help make that process easier. Between our staff we have over 30 winters on the bike here in Boston, so we have some opinions about what works and what doesn’t. With jackets from Swrve and Chrome, gloves and headwear from Gore and Giro, and other cold weather accessories, we can make sure you’re as comfy on your bike in the winter as you are the rest of the year. If you don’t see what you need, just ask! We would be happy to order a different model, size, or color. New products are arriving every week, so keep an eye on our selection. The winter is nothing to be afraid of. Come by and let us help keep you on the bike all year long! comments closed Fall is here… October 7, 2016 and this Sunday we won’t be!

74,"Iron Mountain Counseling | Sandy, UT Iron Mountain Counseling Home About Counseling or Individual Coaching New Clients The Blog Out and About Contact I want to see you be BRAVE Out + About Election Depression November 4, 2016 by Hollie Hancock Leave a Comment Four days. Election Day is four days away.  Then, we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief, right?  Not so fast, Friends.  Many, including myself, are weary warriors still standing shell shocked as we’ve endured the ugly battle between candidates.  And we’ve been engaged in this battle for months.  We need time to recover.  To heal.  As a country, this election has left few unaffected.  To the contrary, many are experiencing what I call “election depression.” Increasingly, many of the individuals who I see have reported unexplained feelings of “feeling down or anxious for no reason at all.”  We discuss the usual suspects, lack of sleep, poor diet, job stress, relationship struggles, lack of exercise, etc.  Most report no significant changes in these areas.  And then it dawns on me: The election.  It’s everywhere.  EVERYWHERE. News of the election dominate the headlines of newspapers.  Endless tweets.  Every other post on social media outlets is somehow related to the election.  Your co-workers are talking about it.  Your friends are talking about it.  Our children are talking about it and asking really conscientious, but difficult questions.  The messages are negative, at times cruel, and even discouraging.  We find that we are feeling more “down and anxious.”  We wait for reprieve. Although, a thrilling World Series Championship Game 7 was just what the doctor ordered for me!  What is there to do to mitigate the final days of this election season, and the days that follow?  I recommend the following: Pay attention to your self-care.  Pay attention to your diet, your sleep, and your body moving.  Further, plan something special for yourself.  How long has it been since you had a pedicure?  Haven’t seen a good friend in a while? Make plans and meet for coffee.  Get a haircut.  Plan a vacation. Pick up that book you’ve been meaning to finish. Give your mind something else to focus on. Turn off your television.  Refrain from engaging with social media.  The chances of seeing or reading something that upsets you are high right now.  Carefully consider what your “tolerance level” is for news and commentary about the election.  When you shaking your head, or letting out long sighs, you’ve breached your tolerance level. Finally, VOTE.  I know, this sounds contradictory to most of what I have been discussing here.  Hear me out.  I completed and mailed in my ballot about 10 days ago.  Surprisingly, I felt better.  I’d made a decision.  I could set aside much of my anxiety knowing that I exercised my civil responsibility.  The pressure was off.  The news, the rants, the social media, the mud-slinging now had little effect on me.  I could ignore it.  My candidate has my support and my vote.  The rest, as they say, will be history. Mitigating “election depression” takes effort.  Feeling better is worth the effort.  You deserve to feel better.  Be patient with others.  More importantly, be patient and gentle with yourself.  Ultimately, the political climate of our neighborhoods, cities, states, and even this country is the responsibility of all of us.  My guide post is something Arun Ghandi said, “Be the change you wish to see in the world.” Isn’t purple a lovely color? Filed Under: Uncategorized Inclusive Family Conference + End Conversion Therapy October 20, 2015 by Hollie Hancock Leave a Comment Inclusive Family Conference + End Conversion Therapy I’ve got a busy weekend ahead of me!  I’m going to be Out + About at two different events! The first, happening on Friday Oct. 23 and Saturday Oct. 24 at the University of Utah School of Social Work (see flyer below), is the Inclusive Family Conference. The aim of the conference is to recognize the importance of all families; in all of its combinations.  All families matter.  Marian Edmonds-Allen (Conference Chair) explains further, “… diversity includes all types of “nontraditional” families, including LGBT, those with mixed racial or religious identities, adoptive, differently abled, multigenerational families, as well as street families formed by those in Utah’s homeless community.” “It’s an honor to have HRC’s support,” Edmonds-Allen said. “The struggle for LGBT rights has moved from only individual protections to include the new reality: entire families supporting their LGBT child, same-sex couples caring for children, children caring for their elderly LGBT parent or grandparent, and more.  All families matter. One of the sessions I plan on attending is Friday evening at 7:00 pm is a plenary session on reparative therapy.  A friend and colleague of mine recently successfully won a substantial lawsuit against an organization that promised one could change their sexual orientation.  This lawsuit will pave the way for legislation requiring the ban on reparative, conversion, aversion, and change therapies for minors.  Don’t miss this!  Presenters include: Michael Ferguson, PhD, J. Seth Anderson, MA, and Scott McCoy, JD. This session is a nice segue in to the second event I am participating in this weekend. On Sunday October 25, I will be meeting with Equality Utah and others to discuss strategies and action plans to encourage legislation in Utah to ban conversion therapies for youth in this state.  I am particularly excited to engage with this group as conversion therapies are unethical per many of the national and worldwide counseling governing bodies, including the American Psychiatric Association, American Medical Association, and the American College of Physicians and many more professional regulatory governing bodies.  I am hopeful that by working on this project that legislation will make it to the floor in the upcoming legislative session banning conversion therapies for minors in our state. I’d love to see some familiar and friendly faces at this event! If you’d like to know where I will be Out + About in the future, check here! Out + About Filed Under: Uncategorized The Mental Health of Alabama’s 2012 National College Football Champions January 9, 2013 by Hollie Hancock Leave a Comment Imagine, the lights, the media, the music, and the confetti, noise that makes it nearly impossible to hear someone literally yelling in your ear explaining that they’re going to get a soda. Imagine being in the stadium with so much tangible energy that moves you to stand up or tap your toes. Last night, the Crimson Tide from the University of Alabama claimed the title once again of National College Football Champions. This is the teams’ second consecutive title and the third title during the last four years. Impressive by any standards. For some of the players, this will be the final competitive game they will play for perhaps the rest of their lives. For the seniors this year, they have three national championships to gloat about. And gloat they should! Three national championships is a big deal! What happens after the music has faded, the lights are all turned out, the confetti is swept away, and the stadium stands quiet? For the players, they will return to school, resume classes and pinch themselves occasionally to make sure their national championship game was not a dream. In a few months, the well-decorated seniors will graduate and start “real life”. This begs the question: Are college football champions and college athletes in general mentally and psychologically ready to go from “hero” to the next stage of their lives? As a former college athlete, I know first hand what it is like to suddenly be without my identity as an athlete. I identified as an athlete and others identified me as an athlete. My athletic identity began as a young woman playing after school sports and little league, continued through high school and then college. An injury abruptly ended my athletic career. Not only was my college career over, any hopes of Olympic dreams ended as well. I was quite literally lost. I wandered, well; hobbled actually, around campus as if it was a place I’d never been before. I saw buildings I thought I’d never seen before. The field house and the track were the only places that really mattered to me and helped define me as an athlete. I’m a bit ashamed to admit that it took me nearly seven years before I was able to come to terms with an early exit from athletics. It was not until I took a long introspective look at myself and acknowledged other talents and skills I had to offer the world did I finally begin to re-define myself. Back to the original question: Are the newest national college football champions ready to re-define themselves? I offer the following checklist for the Alabama Crimson Tide and all other college athletes: 1. I have met or do meet with my academic advisor regularly to make sure that I am on track for graduation . If you’ve met with or do meet with an academic advisor regarding graduation requirements, great job! If you don’t know how to find your academic advisor, or if you even have one (as was my case), do some research and make an appointment. Talk to them not only about what credits and courses are necessary to finish, discuss your plans for what you will do after you leave your undergraduate career. Academic advisors are a great resource for information regarding employment opportunities, internships, and continuing your education. 2. Even though the demands of my college athletic career have taken much of my time, I’ve spent time developing other interests and hobbies. Having interests and hobbies other than sports not only makes you a well-rounded individual, diversifying your interests is good mental health exercise! Remember, all work and no play makes anyone dull. 3. I have close friends who are not associated with my life as an athlete . As athletic seasons end, so do some of the friendships and relationships formed by the common denominator of a shared interest. I am in no way saying that you will not maintain friends from your sport! You will and should! Life tends to have many different twists and turns and sometimes we lose touch with individuals from our past. Being able to establish and maintain friendships outside of the locker room and off the playing field will serve you well in college and as you move through life. 4. I have thought about my life after I “hang up my cleats” and have a plan to gain healthy closure at the conclusion of my college athletics career. If you haven’t started thinking about life after athletics, it’s never too soon to start. Having a plan or making plans following graduation is a great way to set your sights on the next phase and stage of your life. A plan gives you something to think about, focus on, and work toward. 5 . I have wonderful memories, photos, and other things that are a reminder of my time as a college athlete . Never forget your experiences as a college athlete. Some of my best memories are my memories associated with training and competing on the college level. Enjoy your memories. Your memories and experiences will shape the person you will become. Last, but certainly not least, CONGRATULATIONS to the University of Alabama Clemson Tide! Your victory was well deserved and hard earned. May your future endeavors prove successful and fruitful. Roll Tide! Here’s to all of you and your good mental health! Filed Under: Uncategorized A Mighty Change November 24, 2012 by Hollie Hancock Leave a Comment I am very blessed to be surrounded by incredible people. I feel these blessing increase exponentially when I am able to witness incredible people do incredible things. During the past year I have seen Erika Munson create Mormons Building Bridges, an organization comprised primarily of Latter-day Saints, that is dedicated to conveying love and acceptance to LGBT individuals. Groups of Mormons marched in Pride Parades all over the country and around the world with one voice and one refrain, “Love one another…as we love ALL of our Brothers and Sisters, especially our LGBT Brothers and Sisters.” The message was loud and clear. Cheeks were saturated with tears along many parade routes. Recently, Erika received the loudest and longest applause of any speaker that participated in a recent gathering of LGBT Mormons and Allies. In retrospect, I should have stood and applauded her message. It was that good. Rather than dwelling on the disappointment of a lost opportunity, I want to share the presentation that was powerful beyond words as it is a call to action as well. Take the time to read the presentation. Spread the word. Where two or three are gathered: Can your LDS ward be an engine for change? Salt Lake City,Utah November 3, 2012 At it’s best and it’s worst, an LDS ward is like a small town. Everyone can really know everyone. The sheer number of hours we spend together gives us the opportunity to know each other’s back story. The ethic of service runs deep. There can be the unpleasant baggage that goes along with small town life too: suffocating conformity, judgement, grudges held for years. But I remain a huge fan of this imperfect yet oftentimes very effective way of building a Christian community. I am indeed an unlikely defender of our congregations. Though I am devoted to the Gospel of Jesus Christ I have never in any other aspect of my life been a joiner. I am shy, I relish solitude, I hate meetings, I often feel closer to God while walking in the mountains than I do on a Sunday in a windowless chapel designed to withstand earthquakes. I am suspicious of hierarchy and patriarchy. But there is something deeper at work in our congregations that keeps me coming back. I’ve lived in twelve wards in my life. What each experience has in common is that I arrive as a stranger, am embraced by people with whom I only share a geographical boundary and a commitment to the Gospel, and immediately take up the job of working out my salvation with them. This is powerful stuff. I have seen it break down class and racial boundaries I have seen it soften hearts.I have seen it bring about A Mighty Change in myself. People I have judged and disliked have become my friends, not because they changed but because I did. So my message today is that it seems to me we—and by we I mean straight allies and gay members alike–can harness the institution of the LDS ward to make our congregations safe and welcoming for LGBT people. Last spring, as I was deciding what exactly it was I wanted to march for in the Utah Pride Parade, I was teaching To Kill A Mockingbird to seventh-graders. This book is such a classic, it has gained such world-wide popularity that it runs the risk of becoming cliché. But I saw it anew, through the fresh eyes of kids on the cusp of adolescence reading it for the first time. It had a profound impact on me. For those of you who managed to get through middle school without reading Mockingbird or who haven’t seen the magnificent film from 1962, I’ll give you the Wikipedia summary: set in a small southern town during the Depression, the feisty ten- year-old tomboy Scout Finch narrates the story of how her father, a white country lawyer, teaches her and her brother acceptance and empathy as he a defends a black man unjustly accused of raping a white woman. Not only is Atticus Finch courageous in following his conscience when he knows it will lead to public criticism and personal danger, at the same time he is deeply respectful of his neighbors―even the ones who hate him. As the weeks progressed I identified three aspects of Atticus’s character that inspired me. First, Atticus practices empathy. Early in the book Scout comes to her father for consolation after a disastrous first day of school. She’s smarter than everyone, including her teacher, and doesn’t conform to the culture’s definition of what a girl should be. His advice?: If you can learn a simple trick, Scout you’ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from their point of view―until you climb into his skin and walk around in it. Notice he’s not telling her to hide her intelligence or act like a lady. He’s telling her to put herself in the shoes of the person she thinks is her adversary, to try to appreciate the perspective of the “other”. Second, Atticus has a deep loyalty to his community even though his moral compass sometimes puts him at odds with it. When he takes on the case of defending a black man who has already been convicted in the town’s court of public opinion, he prepares his daughter for the turmoil ahead without demonizing his opponents. Come here Scout. remember this, no matter how bitter things get, they’re still our friends and this is still our home. Third, Atticus measures progress in baby steps. It is interesting to note that although his moral choice is extraordinarily significant within the context of his small town, it is very small in scope when you look at the human rights situation in the 1930’s American South. He’s not making any attempt to take down Jim Crow, the much larger, prevailing evil. His goal is well-defined: to get an all-white jury to acquit an innocent black man. Even in this effort, he fails., and his client ultimately dies violently. Yet, amidst this tragedy Atticus is able to find small reasons to hope. He explains to his children: There was one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours. An inevitable verdict, maybe, but it usually takes’em just a few minutes. This time there was one fellow who took considerable wearing down―in the beginning he was rarin’ for an outright acquittal. One juror challenging the culture’s racist ideology for just four hours, was, Atticus felt, something worth noting. Empathy, Loyalty, Hope. Those are the essential qualities of Atticus Finch. Those are the values I wanted to march for. Empathy for LGBT people. Loyalty to the LDS church, Hope for the Future. That would be the mission of Mormons Building Bridges. Now I’d like to share a true story of small-town love. If any of you out there are Radiolab fans this may be familiar to you. In November 2008 while the world was marking the election of America’s first African American president there was a little story out of Oregon that may have represented a milestone just as significant. The town of Silverton, a conservative community of nine thousand many of whom proudly described themselves as redneck, farther from progressive Portland than the actual fifty miles would suggest, in 2008 this town elected America’s first transgendered mayor. Stu Rassmussen has an interesting story to tell. He grew up in Silverton, his dad owned the local movie theatre. He was an alter boy, a technology geek and one night when he was 27 while running the projection booth for the Rocky Horror Picture show he began to sense another aspect of his identity. He continued to pour his life into the town becoming the local cable operator, an electrician, a firmware engineer , and took over the theatre when his dad retired, but very gradually he began to make some personal changes. At 37 he started having his nails done. To promote the theatre, he would walk up and down main street dressed as the female character in whatever movie was opening that weekend. Then he started wearing a padded bra under his guy clothes and finally had breast augmentation surgery at age 52―his girlfriend of 30 years sticking by him. Things were tough for a while. Attendance at the theatre dropped. Trucks filled with boys would drive by screaming hateful epithets. But the town as whole did not abandon Stu. The mayoral race was a close one, but when interviewed the conservative Republican who ran against him did not criticize Stu’s dressing as a woman—he just thought his clothing should be more modest than the low cut sweaters and miniskirts he was now regularly wearing to City Council meetings. Stu won by a narrow margin. On the day when Stu was ready to be sworn in, representatives from The Westboro Baptist church in Kansas showed up to protest with signs like God Hates Overton and Your Mayor’s Going to Hell . Stu’s inclination was to completely ignore them, but two or three of the mayor-elect’s friends decided they would mount a counter-demonstration across the street by appearing in drag. Then quite spontaneously more town members showed up, grandmas, moms with babies in strollers and more guys in skirts. They had grabbed their old yard signs and on the back hastily painted slogans like We Love Stu and Hate is Easy Loves Takes Courage. There were soon 150 people out there supporting their native son, vastly outnumbering the Westboro group. The swearing-in went off without a hitch. Stu was re-elected in 2010 and is running again for another term. This story was thrilling to me. This is small town life at its best. This is Mockingbird re-written with a happy ending. The multiple ways people connected in Silverton facilitated a degree of harmony even for those who couldn’t completely empathize with Stu. Many of his supporters did not try to grasp his gender identity, they didn’t have to because they knew him in so many other contexts. One friend said: “I grew up with Stu―he was an alter boy at church with my brother―he is the town computer geek―he’ Stu the mayor―and then he’s just Stu”. The opportunity that exists in the fictional Maycomb Alabama and the very real Silverton Oregon for those formerly marginalized members of the community to be embraced by it, to in fact lead it– is one we have in our LDS wards and branches. We are organized on a small enough scale that it makes meaningful relationships possible. The fact that we have no paid clergy or staff on the local level and that those positions are continually rotating is democratizing. Right down to testimony meeting there is a strong tradition of egalitarianism, an acceptance of the fact that everyone will take a turn and we will all be patient with one another. Think of all ways an active members can connect with another: we visit each other in our homes once a month, we teach and care for each others’ children, we sing in choirs together, we move each other in and out of apartments, we work in temples together, we bear our testimonies to one another. I believe the bonds we forge in these activities are strong enough to withstand the push and pull that will result when we start conversations about LGBT support. OK- I hear you saying: what is this unitarian universalist/quaker-y mormon experience this woman is describing? Doesn’t she know the LDS church is one of the most top-down centralized churches on the planet? Has she not seen those fold-out organization charts in the Ensign: a skyscraper of thumbnail photos, all indistinguishable old white guys? Has she never heard a bishop preach on unquestioning obedience? Well, of course I have, and first I would like to say that I understand that the grassroots route to change that I am proposing today is not for everybody. For some who have been deeply wounded, there is no coming back. For those who feel they are compromising their principles by putting aside laudable lofty goals in favor of humble ones, I get it, my hat is off to you. But as Mormons Building Bridges has grown we have discovered that there are thousands of Saints out there who up to now have remained silent when they have seen the church turn it’s back on LGBT people but are looking for a way to reach out to their gay brothers and sisters and still remain loyal to, as Atticus Finch would say, “their friends”. You know, I think it is my experience as a woman working within a patriarchy that makes me oddly optimistic. I’ve never been to a bishopric meeting or a high council tribunal, but I see so much good christian stuff happening outside of these venues that I can’t help but want to use it to make the church more inclusive. Think about it, if you are known to your bishop as a faithful home teacher and you ask to be assigned to an inactive gay couple in your ward, might he be receptive? If you and the Sunday School teacher were the only ones who showed up to clean the meetinghouse on Saturday morning, might he in church the next day support you when you point our how hurtful someone’s homophobic remark is? If you wrestle with a sister’s unruly toddler for two hours every Sunday in the nursery, isn’t she likely to listen when you share your experience of being a gay Mormon? If you share with a visiting teaching companion your experience at an LGBT support event, might not she be willing to open up about her son coming out to her? If we are model ward members in traditional ways and at the same time are marching in parades, coming out, bringing our gay brothers and sisters to church, working on LGBT firesides with our Stake President—In all these small, humble ways can we not prove the larger point that acceptance of LGBT people is a logical extension of gospel principles? Maybe. I am under no illusion that at any time fear can win out at the top and result in suppression at the bottom. Furthermore, I have no clear picture of where this will lead. The great story that all our individuals stories add up to has not yet played out. But the daily person-to-person work and heart-to heart conversations that I so admire in small town stories, are beginning to happen in our church and they are valuable in their own right. They are the building blocks of change. The words to Lead Kindly Light have always given me great comfort. They describe the lonely journey of the pilgrim following Chirst’s Light through the encircling gloom. But is there not strength in looking to your right and to your left, realizing that you are not alone. I hope when we look back at this Mormon Moment we will not only remember the national spotlight that descended upon us, but we will mark this as a time we were looking, patiently and carefully, for the light within each other. Filed Under: Uncategorized Champions Among Us. August 5, 2012 by Hollie Hancock Leave a Comment There are moments in our lives when we have the incredible opportunity to witness extraordinary events. For example, yesterday, Michael Phelps collected quite possibly his last individual Olympic gold medal of his career. Tonight, Phelps along with his teammates won the 400m medley relay giving him 18 gold medals. 18 gold medals. 18 gold medals. 18 GOLD MEDALS! I can’t begin to wrap my mind around this. Michael is now the one person in history who has won more medals (22) than any other Olympian. He’s shattered records. He’s wow’d and astounded millions throughout the world. Mr. Phelps is quite literally the gold standard in swimming and perhaps the sporting world. The world is forever changed because Michael Phelps is in it. These very public moments are exciting and remind us of the strength of the human spirit. These moments remind us that hard work and discipline pay off. At times the most difficult work we ever do as human beings is the work we do in the silent chambers of our minds and on the fleshy tablets of our hearts. This is grueling work. Many never know the price paid to live authentic lives. I was introduced to a man a few months ago who has done the grueling work to live his authentic life. Adam Stoker. Yesterday he did a very courageous thing. He revealed his authentic self to his family, extended family, and many friends. Please take a minute to read his story: www.latterdaygay.blogspot.com. As much as I admire and respect Michael Phelps, and appreciate the tremendous hard work he has done over his lifetime, I have to give just as much admiration and respect to Adam for the hard work he has done during his lifetime. Some champions are born to succeed. And then there is a large group of champions born everyday that walk among us. Silently, and often alone, doing the work of realizing, accepting, creating, and living an authentic life. They are the greatest champions of our time.

I dropped in a crossfit class while visiting the San Diego area and was lucky enough to stumble on one of Level Up's mini meal events. These meals are AMAZING! Well-balanced, fresh and yummy... It's not often that you have a great tasting-super healthy meal. I sampled the Indian coconut curry which was delishh. Def wish they had something as good as this back home. It's perfect for crossfitters who want to try the paleo diet, but don't know where to start. Ruby San Diego, CA. A friend passed along the information of Level Up Meals since I'm a recent Paleo convert. And I must say these meals are so good. Very flavorful and because it's completely Paleo it makes it that much easier to stay on track! Highly recommend to anyone who is short on time or doesn't want to take on the daily tasks of cooking your own lunches. Level Up is a simple easy way to keep to the Paleo lifestyle. Farrah B. Escondido, CA. My fiance & I have tried several meal-prep companies over the last year as we are working to look our best for the wedding. Every other plan ended up being monotonous or the quality of food wasn't the level that we would have prepared at home. Level UP has exceeded our expectations.

Read Pro Tips We’re Top Rated For a Reason We strive to put our customers first in everything we do.  But don’t just take our word for it – see for yourself what our customers have to say: We have an elderly mother with late stage dementia.  This disease has taken us on a roller coaster ride and required us to move our mother 4 times in 2 years.  This is both complicated and stressful….with the exception of working with Mastodon. They are an experienced and tight knit group of quality people.  Dave does a terrific job in the planning stage, he assigns a project lead, and the team gets there on time, completes their work ahead of schedule and there are no loose ends.  You feel like you are working with clean cut and well mannered professionals that are superb at their work. They can move heavy weight items, are careful with delicate family items and heirlooms, and they treat everyone with respect.  And they earned mine.  We worked with them 4 times and each experience was perfect.  On the billing and invoicing side there are no surprises, no miscommunications and they can do virtually anything they are asked including a last minute trip to California.  I highly recommend Mastodon. Peter Lucas JJ couldn't have been more attentive to detail and service was excellent. He is a professional in every sense of the word and I would recommend him and his team highly! Jylian The guys showed up right on time and started in on what would be a long day!
They packed stuff that was un-boxed and disassembled furniture for the move and handled huge pieces with an expertise that could only come from true professionals.
On the other end, they managed to get everything in the right room, unbroken and quickly.  The really large pieces needed to be moved up and through some very tricky interior hallways and they did it with some intelligence and true grit!  They'd still be out on the lawn if I had to get them in the house ;) Well worth the price! Jim They moved 2 couches, a very heavy marble table with base, filing cabinet, a large chair and ottoman and a few other items from my parents home to my home. In addition, a couch was delivered to a second home.  They were very careful with the furniture, in particular, the coffee table which was very heavy and fragile.  They wrapped everything appropriately, were very friendly, professional and efficient. Eve JJ and his partner Alan came to the house on time. They did everything we requested at the reasonable time frame, including install the beds. Great job! Zhimin We were moving across town but also putting over half of our house into storage. Mastodon took all our storage items one day and moved our house the next. JJ and his team were great- nothing was damaged and as a result of their organization we were able to get unpacked and settled in to our new place in record time. Bill A couple was advertising a beautiful hutch on Craigslist prior to moving from Weston to the town of Wellesley. I responded to the ad and purchased the piece.  The owners volunteered to have the hutch transported to my house in Framingham at their cost, an incredibly generous offer.  Ironically enough, they had hired Mastodon Movers, a company I had looked into for another possible purchase that fell through when the owners decided to keep the furniture. Four energetic and hard working men delivered the hutch as planned.  I was very impressed because they took such care and moved cautiously through my hallways to the designated room, using blankets to protect the floors.  When they came to a difficult turn in the hallway, they figured out a better method to make it through with the large base section. As two men carried the item, the other two guided them with helpful cueing.  These men were personable, intelligent, respectful of the surroundings, and very experienced movers.  And it was impressive that the owner was present to oversee every detail of the delivery.  I would hire them in the future as I would be guaranteed a safe and successful move. Carol They were cheery and dealt with the insane amount of stairs at both houses without complaining. The 3 guys were super-fast, and never stopped moving except for a water break. They didn't break anything, and wrapped all the furniture professionally, with blankets and saran wrap. They wrestled some really heavy items up 3 flights of stairs, on these insane twisty little crampy Boston staircases. The whole thing took about half as long as I thought it would, and cost about 2/3 as much as I thought it would. Darol Mastodon Moving was on time, had great attitudes and made the whole moving experience totally stress free. I would absolutely use them again and highly recommend their services to others. Ellen F., Weston, MA Mastodon Moving was all that it promised to be and more. The principal called to notify me of a slight delay that morning and then arrived himself and began moving boxes of books and papers and furniture. The move was challenging since it involved pick-up at two related sites and delivery to two distant sites — one in Boston and one on Cape Cod — and went on into the early evening. I was very pleased with the courtesy and diligence of Mastodon’s staff and the care they took with my belongings. Mary Jane, Cambridge, MA I would highly recommend Mastodon Moving for your next move. They were very professional throughout the whole process and had a great friendly crew. We had a big move and Mastodon Moving was organized and efficient on moving us to our new home. They took great care with our furniture and fragile items. Mastodon Moving was a reliable company that made our moving process easier. Cheryl & Rich, Wayland, MA We recently moved into an apartment in Boston after getting married and before moving were concerned about fitting everything in safely and within a small time frame given by our building. Mastodon Moving took all our worries away! They were very careful with all of our fragile boxes and new furniture and at the same time worked very quickly- literally running back and forth from the moving truck and into our building. In addition, they were friendly, professional and a great value. We also thought it was great that they were concerned about the world and donated a portion of their profits to charity- overall, we had an excellent experience with Mastodon Moving and would highly recommend them to anyone.

How did this Dream Come True? Well a lot of Fairy dust and hard work!!!  I have always loved the children’s shows growing up. I felt the characters were talking to me and I was right there with them having Fun and learning something new.  They were so much fun like romping around the room with romper room with my toy stick horse, or listening to Mr. Green Jeans,or Mr. Rogers .They were interactive and oh so simple.  Well, I always wanted to bring that feeling back so all children can experience that.

Follow on Instagram Todd’s Story My life on Oahu was all about the ocean, surfing and shaping boards. I spent every moment I could learning the technology and being with the best. I spent a while thinking of names before Island Inspired really stood out.  Our classic logo represents the Hawaiian islands where we started and what inspires everyone out there: the waves, coconut trees, and flowers. The production of Island Inspired boards started in 1995 while living in Oahu. In 2000, my family and I decided to relocate to the mainland. I grew up in South Carolina and knew this was a great central location for the east coast.  The Island Inspired manufacturing facility was then constructed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In 2014, it was time to expand our product line and geographical reach. Our custom paddleboards were doing really well. It was time to put more focus on that area of our business.  With that growth and the need for more business structure to handle volume, I was drawn to some trusted friends that I went to school with. Outdoor enthusiasts and accomplished in their fields, Greg George and Scott McNew were in the process of forming a capital company. Our thoughts and basis for living just lined up.

113,"Social Security Advocate | Mer Rouge, LA | Sharon Sistrunk Home SSI SSDI Social Security Retirement Contact Call us today! 318-647-3892 Proudly Serving Northeast Louisiana Advocate for social security, retirement benefits, disability insurance and supplement security income Serving Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas Sharon Sistrunk spent 25 years working for the Social Security Office. Since her retirement she has helped people receive benefits from Social Security Disability (SSDI) Income and Social Security Income (SSI). Sharon has served as a Social Security Advocate since January 2009, opening her office in Mer Rouge, LA. Let her years of experience work for you. Should I Get Representation? The annual number of applications for SSDI and SSI is at an all time high. Due to the limited resources of the Social Security Administration and the extreme volume of applications processed, more than 60% of the initial stage applications are currently denied. In the reconsideration of appeal, the number jumps to well over 80%. Given these odds, having a qualified Social Security Advocate such as Sharon Sistrunk and her staff helps you to efficiently and correctly handle your application and the potential appeals process that can be extremely beneficial to you and your loved ones. Having representation will help you to know and understand your options in the case of a denial. In addition, an experienced advocate can help to organize paperwork and medical records, prepare you or your witnesses for a hearing, and will likely have a vast amount of previous experience dealing with the SSA offices and judges in the area. The SSDI application process can be overwhelming, particularly in fairly common circumstances of a denial at the initial stage. Having the experience of a qualified Social Security Advocate like Sharon Sistrunk can prove valuable in getting you the benefits that you deserve. If you are disabled and feel that you are entitled to benefits under the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), please feel free to call our office so we can help expedite your claim today. Common Questions About Social Security Disability Benefits Who can get Social Security disability benefits? When should I apply and what information do I need? Who decides if I am disabled? What happens when my claim is approved? Can my family get benefits? How do other payments affect my benefits? When do I get Medicare? What do I need to know about working? These and other questions can be answered on our website or by contacting us today to make an appointment at 318-647-3892 Contact Information Sharon Sistrunk 308 Davenport Avenue Mer Rouge, LA  71261 Phone: 318-647-3892 Email: anders_sharon@yahoo.com News & Events Coming Soon Home SSI SSDI Social Security Retirement Contact Home SSI SSDI Social Security Retirement Contact © 2017, Sharon Sistrunk.

Ryan Purcell is one of Atlanta’s most renowned photographers, boasting over 12 years creating and capturing noteworthy moments. He has been honored multiple times by Creative Loafing as Atlanta’s Best Photographer and his work has been in publications nationally and internationally. Jenevieve Purcell has more than a decade of experience in logistics, event planning and production.  She perfected her craft out on the open road touring with bands, where high pressure situations demanded creative and swift solutions. Our love story began with an invite to a BBQ.  The two of us met and bonded over chicken wings, bowling and photography.  Our romance was a whirlwind and it wasn’t long before we realized we wanted to spend our lives together.  Six weeks after meeting we were on top of a Ferris wheel with our best friends vowing our love and lives to one another.  From the start we have always made a great team.  We have worked on numerous projects together from festivals to concerts to events around the country.  One day a friend asked if we would photograph their wedding, we agreed and the rest is history!  We quickly realized we both had a passion for wedding and family photography thus Gemini and the Bear was born. When you book with us we do everything in our power to assist in making your day the best and most relaxing it can be.  Leading up to the wedding we put together a shot list for you (of course you are always welcome to create your own), meet for a relaxed consultation over dinner and/or drinks and work with you to build a schedule.  Once on site we will come prepared with a “bridal survival kit” and be there to help in anyway you may need, whether it be holding your bouquet during photos, reeling in Uncle Bob, or grabbing you a refreshing beverage.  Oh, and we will take gorgeous photos for you too! This is all a part of our Atlanta Wedding Photography service package where you will feel like the king and queen on your day. In addition to wedding photography in Atlanta we also offer videography and photo booth services.  Please call or email to book with us today. Let us illustrate your love story! 404-594-2858 Galleries Featured Apr  7, 2017 wedding Margaret + Jacob , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , atlanta , georgia , ryan purcell , groom , bride , portrait , smoke bombs , Five Seasons , gemini and the bear Ryan Purcell Comment Apr  7, 2017 wedding Margaret + Jacob , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , atlanta , georgia , ryan purcell , groom , bride , portrait , smoke bombs , Five Seasons , gemini and the bear Ryan Purcell Comment Margaret + Jacob Wedding // Atlanta.GA Apr  7, 2017 wedding Margaret + Jacob , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , atlanta , georgia , ryan purcell , groom , bride , portrait , smoke bombs , Five Seasons , gemini and the bear Ryan Purcell Comment Apr  7, 2017 wedding Margaret + Jacob , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , atlanta , georgia , ryan purcell , groom , bride , portrait , smoke bombs , Five Seasons , gemini and the bear Ryan Purcell Comment Apr  7, 2017 wedding Margaret + Jacob , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , atlanta , georgia , ryan purcell , groom , bride , portrait , smoke bombs , Five Seasons , gemini and the bear Ryan Purcell Comment Apr  7, 2017 wedding Margaret + Jacob , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , atlanta , georgia , ryan purcell , groom , bride , portrait , smoke bombs , Five Seasons , gemini and the bear Ryan Purcell Comment Apr  7, 2017 Engagement engagement , engagement inspiration , gemini and the bear , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , pittsburgh , ryan purcell , portrait , documentary photography Ryan Purcell Comment Apr  7, 2017 Engagement engagement , engagement inspiration , gemini and the bear , wedding photographer , wedding photography , wedding , wedding inspiration , pittsburgh , ryan purcell , portrait , documentary photography Ryan Purcell Comment Amanda + Connor Engagement // Pittsburgh.

She received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Framingham State College. Lisa is also a Certified LEAP Therapist (CLT), a specialist when it comes to food sensitivities and intolerances. LEAP Therapists utilize the Mediator Release Test (MRT) to help pinpoint and treat difficult cases of food sensitivities or intolerances. Lisa also has a Certificate of Training in Integrative and functional Medical Nutrition Therapy (Next Level Functional Nutrition). Lisa has worked with clients who have seen positive results such as improvement in digestive disorders, relief from chronic migraines, reductions in pain and/or overall relief from fatigue and weight issues. See the Food Sensitivities tab for more info. MY PHILOSOPHY We were all born with a different set of genetics. It is for this reason that there is no one-size-fits all approach to treating clinical symptoms. Our immune systems are all different and can respond negatively to a variety of things that can cause health issues. What might cause one  person to have a migraine or trigger IBS symptoms doesn’t necessarily cause these same symptoms in someone else. I personalize my approach by focusing on nutrition, laboratory results and supplements (if needed). Most importantly, I will work with my patients until symptoms are resolved. I am always available to listen and provide advice. Since you know your body best we will work together to develop an approach that works for you. Stop These Symptoms Anxiety Acid reflux Acne and skin disorders Depression Digestive issues High blood pressure Joint and muscle pain Mouth sores The Journey to Better Health Contact The Wellness RD for an initial consultation Undergo an MRT blood test Use these results to identify food sensitivities and intolerances Have an individualized immunocalm diet prepared Start feeling better Nutritional Services and Support The Wellness RD was established by certified LEAP therapist Lisa Ciarametaro, who has been a Registered Dietitian for 12 years.

143,"Soul to Soul Lifecoach - Home Soul to Soul Lifecoach Home About Contact Unleash Your Greatness and Turn Your Dreams into Form! When you take time to look at your life. all the pieces will begin to fall in place. My mentor Mary Morrissey repeatedly states that, The content of our life is the curriculum of our life. We need to look at our discontent and our longings. They are the biggest clues for our transformation. Our discontent and longings are signs and signals that can help us structure a road map for our lives. Where is there discontent in your life, pulling you away from something? What are you sick and tired of? Where are your longings pulling you toward something? What would you love? You are bigger than any ​ circumstance, condition or event in your life. Goals are growing not for getting. Life is a high stakes game and it will take everything you’ve got to live an inspired life. In the end, it’s not about the job, the relationship, the money… It’s about who you become in the process. ​No one needs a coach, but it can be a great resource to accelerate your awareness of patterns that are holding you back and point you to your own guidance so you can move forward. Why does it seem that ​change is so hard? Why is life coaching valuable? When you have a dream, what will surface is something called your paradigms. Paradigms are subconscious beliefs that limit our progress. Paradigms are the reason we do not advance toward our dream. These paradigms are the source of those relentless voices in our heads giving you countless reasons why you should just give up. What is life coaching? Life coaching is not therapy. It is not fixing what is wrong. It is finding what is right and aligning with it. I partner with motivated individuals to help them access their own genius. What we think and feel determines our actions and our actions determine our results. Our ability to follow our resolutions over time is deeply controlled by what we believe about ourselves. How people change is that they begin to see a different vision and a different image of themselves. My joy is to have amazing conversations that lead you to the genius inside of you. I am passionate about connecting with people who are authentic, genuinely desire and are ready for change, clarity and self understanding. I desire to work with clients who are willing to take responsibility for their lives. I love talking and sharing with others about what really matters. The skills I have learned from my mentors are highly practical and powerful. ​ The key to mastery is to find your happiness and fulfillment right where you stand while at the same time be moving towards a vision of a consciously chosen future. Everyone deserves to live a life they love living. Foundation for Holistic Life Coaching Principles ​ •    Every person has the capacity to live a healthy, happy, productive life, to enjoy well-being and thrive in physical health, relationships, career, finance, and all the endeavors that bring us joy and reward. •    We are multi-faceted beings who experience life through mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual dimensions. Happiness and success proceed naturally when we recognize the whole person and integrate all of these factors. •    We are each responsible for our experiences. We attain life mastery when we identify the power of choice and causation within ourselves rather than attributing our experience to persons and factors outside ourselves. •    We support each other to grow and thrive by listening, validating, reframing, reflecting, and holding the highest vision of each other and our potential. •    Life coaching is a valid, effective, and productive method to resolve issues, clarify our path and purpose, and achieve our chosen goals. •    Authenticity is a primary factor in success and well-being. When we trust and act on our unique inclinations, intuition, and guidance, we succeed. •    Healing and success do not require self-compromise, sacrifice, pain, or struggle. Wellness is achieved by acceptance of self and recognizing the opportunities that difficulties contain. Challenge invites us to grow and become more of who we truly are. •    A Higher Power by whatever name we know it is the source of all life and resides within us. When we accept the presence and love that Power offers us, our life takes on meaning and we gain the ability to fulfill our purpose in life. •    Service to our fellow human beings is the means by which we make the world a better place and find the deepest personal reward.

Technology has transformed the job search ecosystem in the past five years. Resume research with eye-tracking technology shows that employers spend just 6 to 15 seconds scanning your resume before rejecting it. Up to 90% of employers use computerized systems to prescreen every resume, even those received via recruiters or referrals. A resume that does not perform well in computerized systems may never be seen by a human being. A Thrive!

Home Services About Contact Team New School Digital Marketing We jumpstart and scale your business quickly using the latest digital marketing techniques growing your business sustainably. Get Started Now We do not use “hope” marketing: Old school marketing consisted of creating content and linking it back to your site. Instead, we refine your messaging and present it to your ideal clients only. We do not use “old school” methods: The average attention span of a human online is that of a goldfish. Studies have shown that directing traffic straight to your website, does not provide the highest conversion rates. We do things differently: We can still create beautifully designed sites, however, when we advertise we attract your ideal client using value videos and landing pages. We then create a fragmentation funnel, which allows you to speak with ready-to-buy clients.

Testimonials Girls on the Run of Central Indiana When I look back at where our organization was a year ago compared to where we are today, I stand in awe. What we have accomplished in the months that Transform Consulting Group has been working with us is nothing short of phenomenal. We’ve added three new board members, strengthened the overall commitment and engagement of our Board of Directors, started a fund development plan, switched my position to a paid position, and expanded to five Central Indiana counties. It’s been exciting to watch the transformation and growth! Kelly Stokesbury, Executive Director IUPUI Transform Consulting Group brings not only experience but also a thoughtful approach, offering useful suggestions along the way of proposal development. Dr. Khaula Murtadha, Assoc. Vice Chancellor for Lifelong Learning Center for Leadership Development They made the logic model and the process of gathering data very clear and relevant to everyone. Their ability to easily hone in on the needs of the organization and the staff was very insightful and much appreciated. The staff expressed on several occasions that Transform Consulting Group made things clear. I would not hesitate to recommend Transform Consulting Group to anyone. Pamela R. Ross, Former Senior Director of Programs Central Indiana Community Foundation I have had the privilege of working with Transform Consulting Group on several projects. Transform Consulting Group is excellent at writing and editing, helping to articulate complicated issues and plans quickly and effectively. I have also observed their skills in managing programs during implementation. I have been impressed by their servant leadership with their clients, as well their collegian management of other associates affiliated with Transform Consulting Group.

Their good humor –and ability to get things done– truly makes Transform Consulting Group a joy to work with. Lamont J. Hulse, Former Director of Community Collaborations Indiana Department of Child Services I would highly recommend Transform Consulting Group. They were very responsive to our requests and met all of the timelines that were requested.

Our store has been under new ownership since August 2014, and was formerly known as Lucky Bait & Tackle. Immediately after the new owners took over, a very extensive remodel began. They had a vision, and they weren't going to stop until that vision was realized. The goal was to create a one-of-a-kind fishing/outdoor store that every age and skill level could enjoy. We wanted to be a huge advocate for getting kids out of the house and enjoying the outdoors. We wanted to create a store that draws people to El Dorado. A store that would increase outdoor activities at El Dorado Lake by simply having every outdoor necessity right here local. A store that ""feels"" warm and inviting. A store that welcomes every customer that walks in, and a store that thanks them when they leave. A ""bait shop on steroids"", you might say. By the time our remodel was complete, the task of filling our new shelves was already underway. We aimed to carry everything that anyone would need for their next outdoor adventure, and we listened. We asked for requests from our customers and we received hundreds of great suggestions. In fact, over half of the products we carry are highly requested items from you, our customer. We literally have 20x the selection that was available before it changed hands. Every single new item at Angler's has been carefully hand-selected with quality & price in mind.

269,"200 Fingers and Toes Which Stage of Motherhood Are You In? > Welcome, to 200 Fingers & Toes About Me Homeschool Consultation Affiliate, Disclosure and Sponsor Policy Blog For the Homeschool In Due Season Parenting Growing Up For The Writer Read blog & writing life Devotional Life For The Heart and Hands House Grow Eat Create Courses In Due Season Courses My Schoolhouse Teacher Course Chasing our kids, while chasing our dreams Welcome . Hey, I am so glad you came here to the blog. It is the central hub for keeping everything I want to share with you. This is a great spot for me to tell you about who I am and what I am passionate about. Why 200fingersandtoes? I am a mother of 10, there are literally 200 fingers and toes over here, getting into my stuff every day. That might sound like you could never relate to me but, I swear I am normal. Actually I relate even better because between the 10 kids, and being in the restaurant business since 15, I’ve seen just about everything. The entire human condition amplified. That is us. It would make a great bumper sticker for my giant 12 passenger ride. I really do love kids. In fact I have always loved kids, they are my people. I relate because they are on my level. I laugh too loud and love learning new things and really want to go out and play if I could. Homeschoolers are my tribe and I want a community the challenges and inspires me everyday. We homeschool so all of us are here just about 24/7. I love the flexibility homeschooling gave us in the early years as young business owners, and I love the closeness it brings us now. Let’s be real, sometimes everyone wants to punch each other in the nose. We are still human, but we are civil and have big hearts for each other when it matters. My kids came by their big passionate hearts honestly. I have a few passions of my own and I’ve built this blog around them. I have found a lot of products that work and I share them with other parents, teachers and leaders. No one should have to guess with their money or their ministry, I want you to have access resources that I love. I spent a lot of years waiting for someone to make me happy until I realized that person was me. My heart could not be more filled with hope and joy since I started making significant changes to take care of my soul. I want encourage others to embrace self care As a reluctant homeschooler myself, I get the very real challenges we all face with our kids. This drop out, turned 14 year homeschool vet knows that NO ONE should ever be discounted, every kid has the potential for great things. With a k-12 school, I’ve learned as much as 5 average sized families about reaching the heart of an individual, and I’m still learning every day. I love the homeschool community with a passion, and someone needs to welcome this new generation with grace and love. The old homeschool mold is like wearing your brothers shoes, I don’t fit them and I am betting neither do you, but I think we can embrace the future and thrive better if we find our own individual fit.. Here is what you can do from here Hit up the sidebar and subscribe. I hardly know how to use email so you are guaranteed to never get spammed by me. What you will get is the latest posts in a simple format that you can read when you want to. If you got here because you need homeschooling help now check out my posts HERE and info about a Parent to Parent call HERE I am a writer at heart and I love the word of God. If you love Anne Lamott, my DEVOTIONAL essay writing will very likely fall short of her beauty with words. Alas, I am no Anne, but we can be fans together and share the journey and our story. After you are done reading a bit, please like and follow my Facebook page 200fingersandtoes I share a ton of great content from many of the true pros I follow. Thanks a ton for sticking around to the end. If I can help you in any way on your journey in life drop me a comment.

295,"Johnny Sandaire Commercial Photography Studio Toggle navigation PRODUCTS | FASHION | PORTAL | SHOP | BLOG | CONTACT What our clients are saying: Weâ€™ve been working with Johnny Sandaire for about two years now and could not be more pleased. As an importer and distributor of housewares we hired Johnny to do commercial photography of our products for internet, catalog and packaging use. Johnny does excellent work for us at reasonable rates. Not only is he an excellent photographer but his retouching skills (Photoshop, etc.) are also top-notch, which is very important to us. He has always gone out of his way to get his work done quickly when needed, working evening and weekends as necessary. On a personal level he is a warm, optimistic person whoâ€™s extremely easy to work with. I would highly recommend his services to anyone. Benjamin Johnny Sandaire is very nice, upbeat, and pleasant to work with. I am a web designer and had a shoot with Johnny for professional images for my website. Johnny was extremely professional and made me feel very comfortable in front on the camera, not to say the images are completely beautiful, much more than I had expected! Johnny has a great eye for different angles and backgrounds and I got exactly the results I was looking for, only better :) Really recommend Johnny, can't wait to work with him again! Liis Johnny is an amazing and talented commercial photographer. He pays attention to details and places a great deal of emphasis on quality and composition during his photography sessions. His work is rich in color and speaks volume about his ability to render a natural and sensitive lifestyle look. I am very impressed with his photography skills, and each time I have a photo shoot with him, he exceeds my expectations. He is also very creative and sometimes experiments with special effects and composite photography. I like all of his images; his portfolio is a growing evidence of his challenges and talent. He is also well versed in Information Technology and helped me to set up my personal/business website. He was instrumental in launching my business website and continues to be a valuable asset to me as a work on growing my business on the Internet. I feel truly fortunate to work with Johnny. Vanessa Johnny Sandaire is fantastic! He has yet to take a picture of me that hasn't turned out really well! I've needed professional photos twice in the last few years and Johnny was it! I look the best that I have in my life! I can't believe it's me! He is so meticulous in lighting and focus and takes many shots, all this while begin able in real time see the image on the computer and capture it. One shoot was for online stuff, the other for a performance I was doing. Johnny engages easily so I felt very comfortable and actually had fun!! I would certainly hire him again. So in conclusion, if you would like a charming, technically proficient photographer with a great eye, who can catch you at your best, Johnny Sandaire is it. Helen Dr. Sandaire was a pleasure to work with. We hired him to photograph a very important customer and because of the nature of the job, we could not send anyone from our company onsite to be there during the photoshoot. We coordinated everything with Johnny over email and trusted that he would represent us appropriately in dealing directly with the customer. He did a fantastic job! The customer even came back to us and said he was very easy to work with as well as professional. On top of that, the photos he provided were exactly what we had discussed... and all at an affordable price that was within our budget. We would use Johnny again for other customers in this area. Laurie Excellent work on the photos. The jam pan photo, in particular. Thatâ€™s exactly what I was envisioning. Michaelangelo Johnny is very skilled photographer with an exceptional eye for detail. We had a sitting with Johnny for our son's first photo shoot, the photos were beautiful and hang proudly in our great room. Ricardo V. Johnny is an excellent photographer! After going through many photographers, we are glad we finally found Johnny! Johnny was able to deliver the exact product images we were looking for. The quality of the images are topnotch. Great images for ecommerce website applications. Overall great experience.

Our studio offers invigorating, interactive, and imaginative journeys to help your child develop a connection between mind, body, and spirit. When we look at kids today, we see an incredible amount of potential and many opportunities for them to exercise it. Our mission is to profoundly change the lives of children by encouraging our instructors to think boldly. We believe that yoga holds the magic that navigates children toward being healthy and believing in themselves above all else. For many kids, every aspect of life can be about competition. Between school, sports, and popularity, there are more stressors in the lives of our little ones than ever before. Through yoga, we have found ourselves and have learned to be one with our true inner nature. We opened our studio with a mission of sharing our experience with children, and to guide them on a path of unlocking their own inner peace. Beyond children’s yoga classes, we also offer classes for adults and family classes. Our family classes will allow you and your children to experience the benefits of yoga together in a warm and welcoming environment focused on a fun and rewarding yoga practice. At Family Balance Yoga, our slogan is “Stretching Body & Mind...Together!!” because we believe yoga should be a fun experience that fosters creativity and confidence for the whole family.

Contact us today to discuss your home remodeling project today. We offer free consultations and estimates. Small Company. Big Service. Meet The Team ​ Ed C. Master Carpenter ​ Richard C. Project Manager ​ Matt D. Carpenter and Painter Rich was a pleasure to deal with and very responsive. Scheduling time with Rich for the initial consult was pain free and he made us feel very comfortable with his low-key approach. He worked with us to pick out the right shelving, blinds and door for the project and then installed them one morning as I worked from home. Quick and painless! He also consulted with us on a number of other items on our ""to do"" list but we chose to wait on those projects and move forward with the closet and blinds only. We will consider hiring them again when we have other small/medium household projects. Matthew E. Natick, MA These guys are amazing and I'd highly recommend them. Will be calling them again for my next projects. Ed was incredibly knowledgeable so I didn't need to explain much. He knew what was needed and how to fix it. He came on time, did a great job, and was done sooner than expected. Output looks great. He forgot to do one small thing (it was a long list of items), and when we told him he came back over immediately (same day) and did it. Amazing service, and we're very happy with the kitchen as a result! Jim S. Melrose, MA Their work was outstanding! Rich and his crew were clearly very expert in repair work and did a terrific job in each of 3 different areas at 2 locations. They were also very responsive and completed the work in good time. I have no hesitation in recommending this company for a variety of repairs. Helen Q.

330,"Health & Wellness | Santa Cruz, CA | Pamela Cox Wellness Pamela Cox Wellness Home About Work With Me Corporate Wellness Blog Workshops Contact If you or a loved one was recently diagnosed with diabetes, I bet I know a few things about what you're experiencing: Your doctor has given you a whole new diet, and it feels like you're going to have to deprive yourself of all the foods you love - or face the consequences. You've been battling your weight and/or your diet for your whole life and you're wondering what will happen if you ""can't make the change"" this time. Exercise is a four letter word, going to the gym is not exactly your cup of tea and you aren't sure how to ""get fit"". All of the doctor's appointments, medications, carb counting, and new rules for how you need to live your life from now on are overwhelming, and it can feel pretty hopeless at times. You're worried that you messed up somehow, and now your life is going to be different forever. How'd I do? If one or more of these had you nodding your head, I want to tell you something. I hear you I focus on helping diabetes patients (and their loved ones) make healthy life style changes while maintaining  or even reigniting  their zest for life. I'll show you how to make healthy decisions from a place that makes you feel AMAZING, and not deprived. And what you may not realize is  with the right plan, diabetes has been shown to be reversible in many cases. To get started, let's set up a Get Acquainted call. We'll discuss your unique situation, your current lifestyle habits and goals, and I'll share with you how we can work together to taking control of your diabetes and rediscovering your zest for life! Are you feeling like diabetes is a life sentence? Download my free guide, Thriving With Diabetes, that gives you simple strategies to regain control of your health. First Name * Last Name * Email * What People Are Saying Pamela is a very insightful and helpful health coach. She helped me to figure out what issues I wanted to work on and how to best reach my goals. She found excellent information and helpful tips along the way. She has a great sense of humor. I found her wonderful to work with. I highly recommend her. Lonna Larsh My weight was at the highest in my life. Nothing I tried worked. I was frustrated, embarrassed and feeling like a complete failure. With Pamelas amazing support and the IP ketogenic program, I have lost 40 pounds. Pamela helped me discover better eating habits and provided the emotional support I needed for success. I will forever be grateful to her and the journey we have shared. Lori Catalano Before working with Pamela I was struggling to get started on an exercise program. I was lacking the motivation and feeling my Type 1 diabetes could be in better control, but not knowing where to start. She helped me focus on my most important health goals. Her approach helped me discover a new way of looking at my overall health. I learned techniques to stop negative self-talk and how to forgive myself when I didnt meet a specific goal so that I could still move forward. A big result from working with Pamela is my new mind set on exercise. I was able to loose some extra weight and kept it off.  I have found a routine that fits my busy life and my insulin use has gone down dramatically.

OIL Change At Century Tire & Auto No Appointment is Necessary for an Oil Change. Please stop by our Peabody, MA Location Today. Your engine's oil helps absorb heat from the engine and lubricates moving metal parts. Changing your vehicle’s oil is one of the most important things you can do to promote maximum vehicle performance. As you drive, the oil pump circulates oil within your engine and the oil filter catches the deposits that build up. ALIGNMENTS Vehicle A vehicle alignment brings the car's suspension into the proper vehicle manufacturer's specification by adjusting components so that the wheels are aligned with each other and the road surface. Each vehicle's manufacturer designates standard angles for the alignment, specified in degrees which provide improved handling and performances as well as maximizing tire tread life.

Because of all my difficulty I became very inactive. In preparing for the ride, I was able to get some activity back in my life. I did the ride successfully in 2016, I rode 59 miles the first day and 26 the second day. The support I received from everyone was overwhelming. I am training to do the ride again this year. I am going to ride as far as I can each day. My goal is to raise as much money as I can. My daughter Carrie and my son in law Kevin will ride with me for support. My wife Susan will be a volunteer and is also my greatest supporter. This year my daughter Chris and granddaughter Brittany are also volunteering they will be helping at rest stops Please support me today. I’ve set an ambitious goal because I know that with support from people like you we can get there. The money raised will help fund amazing progress in MS research, as well as programs and services that ensure people affected by MS can live their best lives. This cause is really important to me, so I hope you will help me end MS forever. With deepest appreciation, Forrest, (Al) Donate HERE Being active and fit is about being functional.

Francis  / Utah Between an outdoors job and an active lifestyle, most days I shower at least twice. I was wary of combination shampoo/conditioner products after trying drugstore brands, which left my hair flat and dull-looking. The 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner has restored the shine I remember from my younger days! INTENSE REPAIR TREATMENT K. Whitaker  / California I subjected my hair to more than 30 years of color, highlights and perms; strands would literally break when I brushed. I didnt think any product could come close to combating years of damage and sun, but Intense Repair Treatment lived up to its name and its promises. My hair has never felt better. RESHAPE ROOT LIFTER J. Luzzi  / Oregon In my 20s, my trademark was my thick, full-of-body long hair. I never thought Id see that kind of volume again, but Reshape Root Lifter has brought it back. Im 53, and my hair has never looked fuller  or better! REVIVE SHAMPOO W. Scola  / Pennsylvania My scalp and hair have gotten noticeably healthier since I switched to Revive Shampoo. I use very little each time, and just add enough water to work it into a lather. Lots of shampoos say they help with volume, but I think this one actually doesand it doesnt fade my color. My hair looks super healthy and I get compliments about the luster every day! REVITALIZE CONDITIONER A. Rollins   / Florida I could tell just from MONAT Revitalizes incredibly creamy texture that my hair was in for a real treat. Just a dab leaves my hair frizz-free and easy to manage.

My virtual business, using cloud-based technologies, will easily handle your needs from anywhere in the country; I am more than happy to come to you and your farm as is needed to work on specific issues.

Let me show you how to stay ahead of legislation, save money and improve your farms manure and pastures.

Let me come on-site and look at the property to assess current and future problems. I can develop a new and improved plan for the farm, regarding construction, design and/or management.

A virtual bookkeeper will give you the peace of mind that your books are up to date, saving you money and hassle associated with hiring a full-time employee (who gets salary, benefits, worker's comp., etc). The equine industry is highly specialized and book keeping is a specialty for this little understood industry; there are not nearly enough professional equine bookkeepers and accountants who truly understand the equine business/lifestyle, but Kismet Business Services, LLC is a virtual business, using cloud-based technologies to easily handle your needs from anywhere in the country. Along with the ease and simplicity of virtually handling ""papers and bills"" for you, my bookkeeping certifications and education will ensure that your books will be maintained at the highest levels. Thru regular communication, we can help you streamline your business and make it more efficient so you can use the money more wisely to save and improve on your bottom line. As a small business owner, you have more important things to do than to keep your own books. YOUR EQUINE INDUSTRY SPECIALIST Making Your Good horse Business Great! See our pricing! WHAT YOU DON'T SEE CAN REALLY HURT YOUR... (12/20/2017) You have your own business and it does pretty well. You are successful and you do your best to keep up with the books and financials when you have the time. Of course, you are also doing all the marketing, generating new clients and handling all the other aspects of the business. Lets not forget about keeping horses happy and sound, working with the farrier, prepping for the season, staffing, repairing all broke machinery, etc... the list never ends. With all of this under your belt, you realize that t's getting crazy, as is common for all small business owners. Although you are handling the books yourself, are you also taking the time to prepare and look at monthly, quarterly and yearly reports? Are all of your boarders, students and owners set up on automatic invoicing and online payments, or do you still have to generate these yourself? Are any other financial issues slipping through the cracks?  Bookkeeping reports, such as the balance sheet (assets, liabilities and equity), and income statement (aka profit and loss) provide excellent hard pictures of the financial health of the business. What about checking through the way you are classifying your expenditures, assets, etc., to help ensure that you are saving money and are able to avoid the dreaded audit? Do you periodically check ways to save money with your banking, or in other ways in your business? What about ensuring that you are putting profit into your business equation, not just when there is money left over? What these reports and bank reviews can show you may surprise and startle you, too. All too often, small business owners are so busy that really good bookkeeping/financial management gets a once-over. Profit only gets made after all other things are covered, leaving little left at the end. Also, business owners are so personally involved with the business that they can fool themselves about financial issues needing immediate attention, or not make the little changes that can lead to potentially huge savings. The tremendous benefits of having a great and competent person/company looking over your books and business management is that they take the time and extra steps to eliminate/fix all of the aforementioned problems. Great bookkeeping can actually save you lots of money because they are not personally involved. Their goal is your success, making wasteful eliminations and changing routines possible to improve profit and cash flow, or decrease debt. Going through reports and itemization's may seem dull, but these are the very tasks which can dramatically alter cash flow and increase profit.With some extra effort, or by getting qualified bookkeeping help, you will be on your way to increased business savings and financial improvement through careful examination of your books and financial reports. Please contact me if you ever need help decreasing waste and improving efficiency in your business. (352-229-4868, or kismetbiz.site.) In the meantime, have a GREAT holiday season and a Happy New Year. Dont forget to put profit first and trot on.  Jamie WKismet Business Services, LLC Virtual Bookkeeping and MoreYOUR EQUINE INDUSTRY SPECIALISTKismetBiz.site352-229-4868 RECORDS NEEDED TO FIND SAVINGS AND FOR TAXES (11/21/2017) In my last blog, I talked about the importance of good record keeping for your horse (or other) businesses. This blog will give you some good links and a chart of records to keep to help with the process. One of my favorites and a great overall publication that is loaded with information is: FARMERS TAX GUIDE:  www.irs.gov/irs-p225pdf This is a super resource that offers information on: the Importance of record keeping, farm Income and expenses, Soil and Water Conservation expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and much, much more. Two other good publications on business starting and expenses are:  STARTING A BUSINESS AND KEEPING RECORDS:  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf. and TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT, GIFT AND CAR EXPENSES:  www.irs.gov/irs-p463pdf.  The chart below provides information on all records which should be kept and the length of time they will be needed by the IRS These records are the keys to finding deductions, so keep them to allow your bookkeeper and accountant to find you savings. Hubdoc is a fantastic app. That I use that allows you to take pics of all receipts and send them directly to your bookkeeper. All items on these lists need to be kept for recordkeeping for the IRS; several are repeated, but all are essential at tax-time to receive the total deductions available.   Hopefully, these items will help you on your way to increased savings at tax-time, as well as help you avoid the dreaded tax audit. Please contact me if you ever need help getting your business books in order (352-229-4868, or kismetbiz.site. In the meantime, have a GREAT Thanksgiving, put profit first and trot on.  Jamie WKismet Business Services, LLC Virtual Bookkeeping and MoreYOUR EQUINE INDUSTRY SPECIALISTKismetBiz.site352-229-4868 THE BENEIFITS OF HAVING SEPARATE BUSINESS... (11/13/2017) Very often, small businesses (especially new start-ups) blend personal and business activities together. This may make things seem easier in the beginning, and it can sometimes be the only way to start. Unfortunately, if the separation of the two never happens, it will end up doing more harm than good. Not only is it not allowed by the IRS, but it can also rob you of potentially big savings and other business benefits. Because these benefits can be reaped whether your business/farm is home-based, or if you run it out of a separate location, its simply a waste of money if not done. Tax-time is a consistent way for a business to save money, but the IRS requires that business and personal finances be separate to reap these benefits. Done to protect the business owners private finances, it makes filing taxes simpler and the separation of personal and business also enables a clear track of deductions. If you use your personal accounts for business uses, the IRS can be hesitant or not allow those deductions, regardless of whether they are legitimate business expenses. According to the IRS the Burden of Proof is defined as, The responsibility to substantiate entries, deductions, and statements made on your tax returns is known as the burden of proof. You must be able to prove certain elements of expenses to deduct them. When your personal expenses are mixed in with your business expenses, fulfilling the burden of proof becomes difficult to impossible. Take note, for businesses and farms that double as a home, there are strict regulations made by the IRS as to how things can be deducted, making burden of proof more critical. Here is a beneficial link from the IRS regarding deductions for home-based businesses: TAX TIME GUIDE: MANY HOME-BASED BUSINESSES CAN USE SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR CLAIMING HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION: TAXPAYERS MAY DEDUCT UP TO $1500 A YEAR - www.irs.gov This link provides the statement of the IRS regarding keeping your books straight: GOOD RECORDKEEPING HELPS AVOID HEADACHES AT TAX TIME www.irsvideos.gov avoidheadaches If webinars are a more helpful way to get information, then go to link for a page of informative IRS webinars.: WEBINARS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES - www.irs.gov Lastly, this link is an entire IRS small business recordkeeping workshop: SMALL BUSINESS TAXES: VIRTUAL WORKSHOP www.irsvideos.govSo, if you arent already using separate accounts to handle business and personal, year-end is one of the best times to set up your business for great savings and deductions. It only takes a little shuffling of business and personal debit/credit cards and accounts.

Feng Shui is the science of the person-place connection. Joan Kaufman ASID, FSII provides Space Planning and Design specifically geared to promote health and harmony. Feng Shui is an environmental science that is based on interpretation of the natural world. Initially developed by the Chinese to create systems for living in harmony, the principles of Feng Shui provide tools that allow us to interact with the natural world in a supportive, thriving manner. It has been practiced for over 3,000 years. Our Services About/Mission Joan Kaufman ASID, FSII is a certified practitioner in the Pyramid School of Feng Shui, most used in the West. This philosophy of Feng Shui aims to set Chinese principles of Feng Shui in context and, by using modern examples in conjunction with ancient ones, to devise solutions with meaning in Western culture. Todays lifestyles leave us little time for contemplation of our surroundings and how they affect us. Feng Shui offers a way for us to work with our environment. Through Feng Shui, one can identify underlying obstacles and adjust the environment to overcome them. By creating spaces that balance energies and elements, while respecting our natural environment, we create supportive environments that promote well-being.

Auto Service With ASE-Certified Technicians Instead of searching for a competent technician, you should choose an ASE-certified auto technician because they have the knowledge to work on today's high-tech vehicles. Because the ASE program is voluntary, technicians who have taken the time and expense to earn ASE certification can be counted on to have a strong sense of pride in their work. How Does ASE Certification Work? The ASE certification exams are administered in the field by American College Testing (ACT) twice a year at national locations across the country and also online. The exams are crafted by reps from the automotive service and repair industry, vocational educators, and ASE's own in-house technical specialists. Instead of using theory, the exams stress real-world diagnostic and repair problems. Technicians must recertify every five years in order to keep current with changing technology and to remain ASE-certified. Contact us to schedule an auto service!

She inspirited me to go after my dreams and always believed God would fulfill my desires. My mother loved her red lipstick. She once said never leave home without wearing your lipstick, you just never know who may be checking you out. A woman who always made herself presentable; she was a woman who celebrated your grace, beauty and style. She was the example of a Proverbs 31 woman. A woman I continue to desire to be. My mother always had a saying when something was beautiful in her eyes, “Just Lovely” and/or “Lovely”. This is how I came up with the brand name.

418,"False Claims Lawyers, Calabasa, CA | Kester & Isenberg Kester & Isenberg (818) 914-6900 Contact Us Now! Home About The Attorneys Legal Wins False Claims Act Laws Contact Us Representing Whistleblowers to Fight Fraud on the Government Please call the number below for a discreet and confidential consultation directly with Mr. Kester (818) 914-6900 About Kester & Isenberg Kester & Isenberg is a boutique litigation law firm that represents False Claims Act plaintiffs throughout the United States.  Our offices are located near Los Angeles, but we are able to file cases anywhere in the country based on our professional relationships with other attorneys. Very often our clients are current or former employees  i.e., company insiders  that have witnessed or learned about fraud being committed by their employer against the federal or state governments.  Indeed, such fraud is particularly rampant in the pharmaceutical industry where unscrupulous members of Big Pharma routinely seek to increase their profits by unlawfully marketing drugs to increase sales.  Such unlawful marketing can take many forms, but the most common are kickbacks (financial incentives) paid to doctors to cause them to prescribe a particular drug; and off-label marketing, whereby the drug company promotes its drug for medical uses that have not been approved by the FDA.  Significantly, if the government pays for the unlawfully-marketed drug  e.g., via Medicare or Medicaid  then false claims for payment likely have occurred for which the drug company is accountable under the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.  3729, et seq., and under similar state-laws. K&Is attorneys have years of experience successfully representing bona fide whistleblowers, and obtaining significant multi-million dollar recoveries for the government, which are shared by law with the False Claims Act plaintiffs.  (Please see the Legal Wins webpage for discussion of the successful cases handled by K&Is attorneys.)  Furthermore, K&I usually represents its False Claims Act clients on a contingency fee basis; thereby allowing our clients to pursue their claims without paying expensive hourly attorneys fees. If you have witnessed or learned of fraud being committed against the government, then please contact K&I immediately to discuss your possible False Claims Act case.  You will speak directly with a K&I attorney, and all such communications will be private, privileged, and protected from disclosure regardless of whether K&I is retained. $762 Million Global Settlement In this case, Kester & Isenbergs client was a former employee who alleged that for years Amgen had engaged in various illegal kickback schemes that resulted in millions of dollars of unlawful billings to Medicare and Medicaid. $28.8 Million Settlement Mr. Kester represented three former employees who asserted that Aegerion Pharmaceuticals had been unlawfully marketing its very expensive orphan drug Juxtapid to increase sales and profits. $18 Million Settlement Mr. Kester represented a former employee of the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Acclarent, who alleged that Acclarent had engaged in unlawful off label marketing of various spacers that were used in connection with certain nasal surgeries.

Learn How To Take Your Images To The Next Level I have already received so much from the club. I am a new blogger, and I have had my camera for almost 3 years and did not know about its features or how to use it. Overnight I have become a better photographer with your help and on my way to gaining additional skills. Even my tripod that I have had for the same length of time, I am learning to do things with it that I did not know existed. No joke, but my tripod allowed me to take overhead shots. I laughed so hard (big dummy) and I discovered this after taking one of the courses. So this club has been invaluable to me and it can only get better. Sharnette Walker Founding Food Photography Club Member Who Started This Club? Hi, I’m Christina Peters and over the past 25 years I’ve been a professional photographer. Â I actually went to school for it and have two photography degrees and won several awards along the way. Â I decided to specialize in food photography and have had the pleasure to teach over 10,000 people in more than 60 countries how to get better food photos. Â I wrote a popular food photography ebook as well called Food Photography Tips and Tricks; The Ultimate Guide 2nd Edition. I started the Food Photography Blog in 2011 and that’s what led to teaching food photography classes at my studio in Los Angeles. Â These classes are what shaped the Club. Â All of my students taught me what to teach you by sharing their painful struggles with their food photos. Â So trust me, I KNOW what you are struggling with and I can help you work through that! To the left: Â That’s right, I’m painting the steak! Â I’m painting it with oil to make it look tender and juicy. Â No one wants to see a dry looking piece of beef! I love this Club. I have learned more here than in previous outlets. You are an excellent teacher. I am not afraid to not know things. I was afraid in other places to say “what’s that mean?”. I am not a techy person so navigating around the site is getting a little easier for me. (Like I said, I am returning to photography after a very long hiatus.) Kudos to you for doing this for “us” and making it easy as well. Phyllis Marcantonio Founding Food Photography Club Member Having Christina as a mentor has been a cornerstone for my site and photography. Following her advice and direction, my food photography practically improved overnight and my audience has doubled! Not one to hold anything back, Christina has answered all of my questions in all aspects of photography, from theÂ creative sideÂ to the business side, and everything in between. In the short time that I’ve been learning from Christina, I’ve gained invaluable skills that helped me expand as a well-rounded, versatile, and more confident photographer.

Honestly, this Club is the best! I’m sooo happy I found it. There is nothing else like it for us photographers who like to shoot food. I spent a year and a half taking photography courses at a local university extension program (12 in all), and while in that community I couldn’t find anybody, teacher or student alike, that could answer any questions about food photography. No one did it. Since then, it’s been about the same. I’ve bought several food photography courses from websites like Creative Live. They’re o.k., I learned quite a bit from them, but there is nothing out there where we can get our questions answered on the spot by someone in the industry who is literally guiding us through this experience. We’re all busy. I know I don’t have time google this stuff, only to find out they left out a large portion of information. Anyone serious about learning food photography needs this club. I’ve learn a lot so far. The first thing I did was take all the courses, even if I felt they were too basic. Yes, they were a little basic for me, but because they were taught specific to food photography, I picked up quite a bit of information. I remember having an “ah, ha” moment when one of the courses covered putting your camera into a “neutral” color space. Previously, I had shot strawberries where the color was way too saturated, and I couldn’t fix it correctly or figure out why it happen. I changed the setting and now my reds are fine. Seriously, I was ready to get my camera serviced until I heard that. Also, I’ve learned a lot from reading your answers to others as well. So, thank you again for creating this club! Teri Surratt Founding Food Photography Club Member I am so excited to announce our partnership with the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank .Â  A portion of every membership will go directly to them. Â Every dollar donated enables them to give four meals to those in needÂ – just $1! Â It’s truly amazing what they have accomplished and I just can’t wait to see how many meals we can help them distribute. Â In 2016 they distributed 55 million meals!!! I will update our total every monthÂ with how many meals we have donated together. 2868 meals have been donated as of May 31st, 2017 from Food Photography Club memberships. As a professional food stylist, I know what it takes to make food look amazing for the camera… anticipating what the camera will see. A while back, I landed a gig that required me to supply the finished images of the food and then it dawned on me that I knew nothing about how Â the camera actually sees the food. With what little time I had to spare, I tried learning about photography through books and internet searches, but those mouth-watering images totally eluded me. Enter Christina Peters. Christina has a way of breaking down the basics of aperture, depth of field, ISO, lenses, lighting, etc. into easy to understand concepts. After taking her course, a few questions and a lot of practice, my photography skills have improved immeasurably… so much so that I now have food photography clients! Thank you, Christina, sharing your knowledge in such a comprehensive and understandable fashion! Jeff Parker Food Stylist, Food Crew Inc. Who This Club Is For: COMPLETE BEGINNERS : Â Are you just starting out? The Club is perfect for you. There are courses for every step of your journey in food photography from beginner courses to advanced and you can start with any course that you like. Â Though it’s set up to go in order, you don’t have to learn in any particular order if you don’t want to. FOOD BLOGGERS: Â If you have a food blog, you must have great food photography. If you start taking great images of your food, you could start doing sponsored posts and getting paid for makingÂ your recipes. Â How fun would that be? CHEFS & FOOD STYLISTS : Â How awesome would it be to be able to take great photos of your beautifully styled food? Whether you are trying to grab images in the kitchen with your smartphone, or get a beauty shot of your dish, photographing your food is extremely important to show potential customers what you can do. RESTAURANTS: Â Maybe you own a restaurant or you work in a restaurant. Â Your customers will come running when you post amazing food photos of your daily specials and other menu items on your social media sites. CULINARY STUDENT : Â Many culinary schools are having their students photograph their dishes as part of their assignments.Â If you can photograph your recipes, you’ll be way ahead of the class. Â If you decide to become a food stylist, you will have a huge advantage over others if you know about food photography. CULINARY INSTRUCTOR: Â Gain more respect from your students with breathtaking photos in your teaching materials. Â Gain new prospects and train your students that the presentation is just as important as the taste. CULINARY PROFESSIONAL : Â Do you have to photograph food or beverages as part of your job? Â Maybe you work at a cookware shop or for a PR firm that specializes in representing food clients. FOOD COMPANIES : Â It’s now quite common for food companies big and small to have many of their employees photograph the food or beverage product that the company they work for makes. I’ve taught several food companies how to take pictures of their food. Â Or maybe you are bringing a food product to market for the first time and just can’t afford to hire a food photographer. Â This club would be great for you. PHOTOGRAPHERS: Â If you are just starting out in photography and are interested in photographing food for fun, this could help you get a great start. Â If you are a seasoned photographer switching to food photography, then when our advanced courses are ready, you can jump ahead and go right into lighting, food styling and post production. Â There will also be in depth courses on the business of food photography as well. As a Food Stylist with a desire to start a recipe blog I knew I wanted my site to include beautiful photos. The only problem was that I knew nothing about using a dslr. I couldnâ€™t change my aperture, didnâ€™t know how to set a focal point, and didnâ€™t have a clue about lighting. Luckily I met Christina! With her thorough instruction, patience, and passion for teaching food photography, my skills greatly improved. Not only is Christina skilled at teaching newcomers the basics, she also has the great ability to teach advanced techniques in a way which is accessible to anyone. With Christinaâ€™s instruction and continued support, my photography skills and blog continue to grow, which I donâ€™t see stopping. Michelle Ferrand Food Stylist, Cup of Zest What Comes With Your Membership  VIDEO COURSES Every module has several videos with each lesson organized and easy to find.  DISCOUNTS All members will get discounts on various products and workshops  PERSONAL FEEDBACK The only way to learn photography is with lots of direct feedback  IMAGE CRITIQUES Get critiques on the images you’re working on t Assignments & Quizzes Most lessons will have assignments and quizzes – don’t worry, they aren’t required to move forward  COMMUNITY FORUM The forum will be where you get feedback, support and advice on your food photography i DOWNLOADABLE CHEAT SHEETS Many lessons will have downloads to help you along the way  RESOURCES Loads of curated and updated resources put together for each course.  WEBINARS & WORKSHOPS Christina will be hosting several live webinars on various topics throughout each month & will do workshops as well I love it !!

As a beginner, novice photographer I am quiet amazed at how generous everyone is with their knowledge and sharing their experience!! Nora McGurrin Founding Food Photography Club Member 30 Day Money-Back Guarantee There’s a ton of content here and I’m sure you’d like to poke around and see if this is really for you. Â So you’ve got 30 days to try out the club. Â If within the next 30 days you change your mind and feel you are not getting the value you want, just cancel your account for a full refund. Â Simple. We also make it easy for you to cancel or pause your account in the future too so you’re not stuck in any contract of any kind. Â If you pause your account, you can start up your membership again when you are ready to continue on your food photography journey in the club. I think this club is truly amazing. You have brought together a group of passionate food photographers who are eager to learn and are willing to help each other, with your guidance, through this process. The lessons you have uploaded are very thorough, and even if I have knowledge of the basic camera use or photography techniques (thinking I could skip this bit), I still learnt something I didn’t know through your videos. Your calm and gentle manner makes learning technical things less intimidating. I love how involved you are with the club and the forum; you’re always there for us. Seriously, I don’t know how you do it! Monica Jiandani Founding Food Photography Club Member Frequently Asked Questions Can I cancel any time? Yes you can! Â You’ll be able to cancel your membership to the club from your account. If you cancel your account, you have access to the club until the end of your monthly billing cycle and we do not offer partial refunds. Can I pause my account? Yes you can! Â This is best for the monthly subscription. Â You’ll be able to pauseÂ your membership to the club from your account. Â Once you pause, you will have access to the content through the end of your monthly billing cycle. Â Then, when you are ready to come back, “Resume” your account and your billing will start over on the day you resume your account. Pausing a yearly account does not extend your subscription at all. Â It just stops the system from renewing your yearly account until you come back for another year. I'm a total newbie and know nothing about my camera, lenses or lighting. Do you have courses for me? Absolutely! Â The majority of my students are completely new to photography, not just food photography so I teach you all the basics first and give you a good foundation, THEN you will learn to improve your new skills. Â This club is designed to grow with you. Â The first courses are foundation courses – how to actually use your camera. Â The second set of courses are more advanced and focused on what your images look like. Â Then the advanced courses will be about making money with your food photography and running a food photography business. Â Plus Christina will be doing live webinars every month to make sure you get all the help you need. Will I have access to all the courses when I join the club? We are launching with all the beginner courses. Â As new courses are added, you will have access to it all. Â Even after we have all the content completed,Â you can start learning in the club at any level. Can I buy the courses separately? No you can’t. Â You get access to content while your membership is current. How are the courses delivered? The core course content is always available in video lessons that you can watch at any time at your own pace. Live webinars will be announced in advance and if you are not able to attend the live webinar, it will be recorded so you can always watch the replay later. I don't even have a camera yet, can this club help me choose which one to buy? Yes! Â The very first course is all about the photography equipment that you will need to do food photography. Â There are lesses on how to buy a camera, what lenses you will need and some other equipment that should also be considered along with the Camera Buying Guide. Will the price go up after I enroll? Not at all. Â Once you join, that will be your price for as long as you are a member until you cancel. Â If you choose to pause your membership, we will honor your membership fee for 6 months. Â If you choose to pause your membership for longer than that, the price will go up to the current price in the club. What payment forms do you accept? We take all major credit cards and we also take Paypal. Do you offer free trials? No we do not. Â We will let you cancel for a full refund within your first 30 days. I'm so overwhelmed with my camera, I have no idea where to start! That’s ok. Â As soon as you join the club, Christina will walk you through the club and explain exactlyÂ how to use the program so that you do not get overwhelmed anymore. I know I'm going to have loads of questions, how do I get them answered? With membership, you will have access to all the live webinars that Christina does regularly. Â There will be Q & A webinars along with ones on certain topics. Â One of the best things about the club is our private user forum that we call The Club Room. Â TheÂ Club Room will be very organized with specific topics all about food photography. Â If you missed a webinar, you can post your question in the forum for a quick response. Will new content be added after I join? You betcha! Â This club is for you. Â There will be monthly webinars and online workshop to get some real hands on practice along with a new course being addedÂ regularly along with Quick Tips. As a Founding Member, you are helping to make this club what you want it to be. Â We want your feedback, we want your suggestions about what you want to learn. Â As new content is added, we take all your feedback into consideration when making it. I've already been shooting for a while, is there content for someone advanced like me? When we first launch, there will be the 6 core foundation courses. Â These are more for beginners. Â Each month we will add a new course, so for the advance photographers there will be courses on building your portfolios, running your business and how to get clients. Â Those advanced courses will be added later as we are making courses in the order of Beginner, Intermediate then Advanced. Â Each time we add a new course, an email will be sent out to notify everyone of the new course. Â If you feel we don’t have your content available yet, make sure to add your name to our email list so that you will be notified of new courses when they become available. Can I get one-on-one help with my food photos? You sure can! Â Christina will be doing image critiques regularly so you can get real feedback on your images. Â It’s one of the best ways to improve your food photography. Â In the Club Room Forum there is one forum dedicated to getting your images reviewed. If you don’t want public image feedback in The Club Room, then from your dashboard, you can submit images to Christina for review. Â This is a private email exchange with Christina. Do I have to go in order of the courses, or can I do the courses I want when I want? You can do any course you want at any time. Â Let’s say you already have your photography gear and want to learn lighting. Â You can jump right into that. Â Then down the road if you want to upgrade your camera, then you can take the courses on buying cameras to refresh your memory on what’s important when buying one. Why should I join today instead of waiting? So here’s the thing. Â We just launched this club. Â As we get more members and add more content, the monthly price will go up. Â The only way to lock in your price is to join today. I have more questions - who can I contact? If you didn’t see your question listed here please email us at support@foodphotographyclub.bom and we’ll get back to you right away. I just don't know if I should do the monthly payment or the yearly payment. If you think there are only a few courses you are interested in, then do the monthly payment. Â If you are a beginner, you will get a lot of value by doing the yearly payment plan. Â There are photography courses out there for $150 – $300 that don’t cover half the content we cover here in the club. Â So for the yearly fee, you get access to all the current courses AND future courses PLUS access to Christina in the webinars and on the forum. Â Plus with the yearly payment, you get two monthly free! Love the club and am learning a ton. I’m really enjoying the club room and getting to learn from comments on other people’s work and questions. The videos are well-put together and move at a nice clip with no wasted time. I love that there’s new content always being added. Autumn Hoverter Founding Food Photography Club Member Do you still have questions?

The Billow was designed to give your breasts and body a soft and supportive “hug” post surgery and provide comfort long after. We know what it’s like to have breast discomfort and designed the Billow for perfect breast, back, under arm and neck support while sleeping, relaxing or getting massage therapy. The Billow pillow is made in the USA of organic, chemical and cruelty-free materials. Although you may use your Billow how you see fit, these Billow pillow positions may help to alleviate stress and pain. Embrace The Billow pillow keeps your torso raised and slightly elevated without compromising sensitive breasts and stomachs post surgery. This position is beneficial in providing relief proceeding facial or cardio thoracic procedures as well. The Billow roll pillow may be used to provide extra support behind the neck in this position. Side Relief Billow pillow provides support to the neck and shoulder while lying on your side. Using the Billow roll pillow in this position provides extra comfort between the breasts or legs. Blissful Breasts The Billow pillow provides breast, under arm, neck and lower back support for those with extreme sensitivity in those areas. This position provides maximum comfort while lying on your stomach or getting a massage and is perfect for post surgery, nursing moms, or anyone who has larger breasts or needs extra back support while lying on their stomach. As Seen In “My Billow is fabulous! My stomach is still a little sore from my recent surgery so I wasn’t able to lie all night, but lying on my stomach for an extended period of time was fabulous. You have designed an absolutely wonderful product!” Kim C. , North Carolina, USA “I tried the Billow at our Advanced Breast Cancer Group at the Cancer Support Community in Bridgewater, NJ. Stage IV, for 12 1/2 years, in treatment continuously for all this time. Due to mets, surgery, and instrumentation I have not been able to sleep on my stomach – which had been my favored position. When I tried the Billow today, 2/4, I was actually able to lie on my stomach and turn my head! Yippee! Amazing how the littlest things become so magnificent. Thanks for the support, both literally and figuratively.” Alice G. , New Jersey, USA “Fabulous! I received a massage today and used the Billow and it was awesome.” Leslie M. , New York, USA “Another success story! Used the Billow for a nursing mom in her massage session a few days ago and she loved it – it brought her a lot of relief.” Leslie M. , New York, USA “Through training for the half ironman my back took a beating. Sleeping with Billow enabled me to rest comfortably and soothed my back aches. I will never sleep with out it again!” Ariana C. , New York, USA “It is so comfortable and fabulous and I will continue recommending it to patients and friends.” Alice C. , New York, USA “The Billow was a hit. She said it was very comfortable. She is planning on getting pregnant again and thinks it will be very helpful.” Dr. C. , New York, USA “As a licensed massage therapist, I am so excited to introduce the Billow to my clients. I have received wonderful feedback from my clients! Not only is this product helpful for breast cancer patients, it is a must-have for performing massage on large-breasted women. Yes! They are finally lying comfortably on their stomachs!! I have found it to be very beneficial for male clients as well. In fact, it provides support for the lower back and allows for a much more comfortable surface for all of my clients.” Ruth R. , West Virginia, USA “Just writing to say that I love my Billow. I bought it because I had a double mastectomy (and will continue to use it after, I love it that much)!” Shelia , New Jersey, USA We have had some incredible feedback from attendees with all types of cancer and situations…We love Billow Global!

LANDING Christian Messemer 2015-09-24T12:48:52+00:00 Student's Ally Information on scholarships is abundant, but not always helpful. With class, work, and extra-curricular activities, most students do not have time to become scholarship experts. Luckily, you do not have to become an expert, you just need to be trained by one. Parent's Support Most parents have a hard enough time paying the everyday bills and saving for retirement, much less paying college tuition. Your lack of resources does not mean that you cannot be a resource for your child. Let me teach you how you can be part of the scholarship process and partner with your student as he/she pursues a debt-free degree.

We don't use soccer demands from the past to develop future players. It is not possible. f.c.MyTeam focuses on predicting, adapting and training for the future of soccer. We prepare players to play in new condition what bring new soccer. There is no time and space to react like before. We need to adjust to new modern soccer game. Soccer is experiencing evolution and we try to anticipate what soccer will be like in 10-15 years. f.c.MyTeam tries to make a comprehensive program for developing players. Physical, Technical and Cognitive components are evenly spread through our program. Club Teams Private Training Our Technology Why We Use Technology? In order to keep our training programs aligned with the direction in which soccer is evolving, f.c.MyTeam takes advantage of science and technology to optimize a player's physiology. We don't use technology to determine how much talent a player has, we use technology to improve each player striving to reach his own maximum potential. In addition, we have the ability to monitor in 24 hours a player's activity and rest time. Interestingly, there is a large discrepancy between estimates and actual assessments of how active players are outside of training. With these tools, we can better understand players' energy expenditures, such as during a full day in school, or even suggest how to maintain physical condition while they are on vacation. The chart below is an example of how f.c.MyTeam uses data to learn about, prepare and develop our players. <a href='https:&#47;&#47;www.fcmt.website'><img alt='&lt;Game report&gt; ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;fc&#47;fcMyTeam&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a> Our Focus Is Not Scouting For Players, Our Focus Is Try To Develop Players. The difference between training with Coach Milan and playing college soccer is very impressive. The time that I spent training with Coach Milan has helped me gain the essential skills to play at the college level. He works a lot on your physical conditioning and teaches you how to adapt many styles of play. In my opinion, he is one of the best coaches in the area... He puts his whole heart into what he does, he wants each of his players to put everything that they have and fight for your teammates, to push each other out of our comfort zone and improve in every aspect of soccer and in life. During my time with Coach Milan, I have improved greatly both in soccer and in my studies. Daniel Panete Citrus College College soccer is all about height and strength. Tactics are very robotic and not used fully. This general form of college at is to my taste far below the understanding Milan has of soccer. He judges players on talent and intelligence and puts a large emphasis on tactics mirroring professional ones. Thus Milan creates a style of play above the one currently being produced by colleges across the nation. Adrian Tlantenchini University Irvine My experience with Coach Milan has been life changing. From the first practice I had with him, to the last, I recall always being amazed to the types of training sessions and lessons he taught us. Unlike other coaches I previously had, Coach Milan always gave new exercises and drills for the development of the players. He inflicted a new objective and lesson every practice he gave. Coach Milan's lessons were not only directed towards soccer. He would explain to us how we could carry the lessons he taught us and apply them to our daily lives. There was always so much to learn. Coach Milan was very direct and honest when he addressed his players. He would catch a mistake from a player and would explain to the entire team the reasons why should be avoided.

And wisdom to teach you each technique in the most efficient, effective, and enjoyable way. Safety.

D’Angelo “There is no ‘One Thing’ a district can do to reduce the risk of a targeted act of violence at their schools.  However, one of the best practices is creating a positive school climate in their schools.  Not only is this the most effective strategy, it is also one of the least expensive. I ‘met’ Cheryl Spittler through her writings and posts on LinkedIn.  As the chairman of the National School Response Conference, I had the opportunity to invite Cheryl to be a presenter at the 2016 conference.  Not only did Cheryl engage the delegates during her presentation, Creating a Positive School Climate, she modeled the behaviors she taught.  Cheryl’s presentation was one of the highest rated presentations of the conference. She was able to connect with the delegates because they recognized her as a colleague who is in the field working with the same challenges they face. The strategies she taught can be used at any school by any teacher and principal. If your district is looking for strategies to improve your school climate, I highly recommend Cheryl Spittler.” Gary L. Sigrist, Jr. CEO and President of Safeguard Risk Solutions LLC “Attending Cheryl Spittler’s breakout session during the National School Response Conference on “Creating a Positive School Climate” presented a fantastic opportunity to not only reinforce the importance of why school climate Does Matter for an environment conducive to learning, but also provided additional ideas and discussion on HOW to create, implement and engage stakeholders.   Cheryl did a magnificent job in presenting the multi-disciplinary approach to creating a positive school climate.   Her presentation provided me with additional tools and approaches to addressing campus climate challenges.” Steven K.

Keep up the good work Sir. Kirsten Barnes June 14, 2016 I have been training with Val for the past 3 years and it has improved my game so much. He has shaped me into the D1 Athlete I am today not just psychically but mentally too. The competitive atmosphere at ESSA is awesome and I would not want to train anywhere else! Rick Meyer March 2, 2016 My son Tommy has been training with Val Barnaby for 6+ years and has achieved outstanding results in the way of strength, speed and agility. In his early years, Val prepared his body for the weight training to follow. He then taught him proper and safe technique which he has carried forward into his HS weight room. He demands hard work and achieves that through the special bond that he develops with his athletes. Nicole Kelly February 4, 2016 Val Barnaby is a game changer.   Whether you are 14 or 40,  he brings out your very best.  You are lucky if you have the opportunity to train with him.  Thank you Val, for being such a positive influence in my family's life! Bob Mulrenan January 15, 2016 My son Matt Mulrenan has gained speed, agility, strength and most of all, confidence to be able to overcome obstacles. If not for Val this would not have come.

/> Spiral Inquiry Home Blog Publications Links Contact Read The Journey OUR JOURNEY An Exploration of Science, Faith, and Philosophy THIS IS THE STORY OF MY JOURNEY We are all trying to understand the world we live in and searching for ways to improve our lives, the lives of others, and the world we live in together. While some might say we go one step back for every two steps forward, I like to think of this process as a spiral. We revisit each question, each challenge and each idea time and time again. But when we come around the next time we have learned something.  Our understanding has expanded, like the successive rings of an outward spiral. “The universe has given us life, beauty, joy and self-reflective consciousness - it has loved us.  In turn, it is possible for each of us to reciprocate this love.” -George Gantz, The How and The Why of Emergence and Intention Science --- the study of the physical world and how it works.  The practice of science is observation and mathematics is its principle tool.  Science yields understanding and, through technology, mastery of the physical world.  This is not always used for good purposes. Faith --- one’s personal inquiry into what is right and good.  Many of us find our roots for this inquiry to be in religion, others in the humanities, some in their community.  While the sources may be different, there are universal principles on which most of us will agree. Philosophy --- the use of human reason to increase wisdom, the goal of which is to live a life that is right and good.  This is the original intention and meaning of the word “philosophy.”  Scientific understanding is a start, but faith provides the compass that points us towards the goal. Newsletter SignUp Email * Opt out of email lists PHOTO CREDITS PHOTO ONE – The spiral of a distant galaxy, viewed from the Hubble telescope, brings to mind big questions of space, time, gravity and energy and our never ending quest to reach for and grasp the stars. PHOTO TWO – My friend Steve Engler suspended a light from a string and exposed this image on a photographic plate in his basement. Computers may simulate mathematics, but the Earth, the heavens and a simple pendulum bring math to life. PHOTO THREE – The sunflower, in its journey, searches for life and finds it in exquisite interlocking spirals, rotating both right and left, an expression of beauty and joy. PHOTO FOUR – The chaotic complexity of electrical, biochemical and quantum reactions, flowing through trillions of neurons, remains inadequate to explain consciousness and free will.

Hiring a professional HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning) firm is an important component of good health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): The function of a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is to provide for more than human health and comfort. The HVAC system produces heat, cool air, and ventilation, and helps control dust and moisture, which can lead to adverse health effects. The variables to be controlled are temperature, air quality, air motion, and relative humidity. Temperature must be maintained uniformly throughout the heated/cooled area. There is a 6ºF to 10ºF (-14ºC to -12ºC) variation in room temperature from floor to ceiling. The adequacy of the HVAC system and the air-tightness of the structure or room determine the degree of personal safety and comfort within the dwelling. 1291 N US Hwy 1, Suite 7 Ormond Beach, FL 32174 License #CAC1815539 (386) 441-0903 (904) 608 9971 dispatch@weberac.com Contact Us Ormand Beach Daytona Port Orange Palm Coast New Smyrna Beach Flagler Beach Putnam County Clay County Duval County £ 0.00 0 items",Construction

Mission Technology Applications About News & Events Contact Us Mission Technology Applications About News & Events Contact Us making energy cleaner Power generation capacity is set to double in the next 25 years, no matter what the fuel source: nuclear, natural gas, coal, geothermal... Global CO2 emissions need to be cut by a tremendous amount, and one of the most salient emitters currently are power plants. More than 85% of the world's power still comes from steam power plants, and these plants are more inefficient than they need to be. Drop Wise 's mission is to use our unique coating materials and application process to make inroads on efficiency in power generation. Each plant that applies a Drop Wise coating will be offsetting, on average, an amount of carbon equal to taking several thousand cars off the road. Globally, the CO2 impact of Drop Wise coatings has the potential to offset more carbon than the entire global solar installations from 2013. We believe strongly that this is a mission worth working towards. Saving Water As the second largest consumer of water on the planet, thermal power plants will play a significant role in the availability or scarcity of this resource in the future. Drop Wise coatings enable a power plant to generate the same amount of electricity with less coolant water, by enhancing the thermal transport and extracting heat from condensing steam more efficiently. This is good news for power generators, who are faced with increasing restrictions from coolant effluent regulations.

Why should I see an esthetician? Esthetics is the application of various treatments to the skin, to maintain its health and vitality. Estheticians are trained in skin wellness, helping their clients balance oil and moisture content and achieve a healthy, youthful complexion. As well as various facial treatments (described in more detail below), they commonly also perform body treatments such as salt or sugar scrubs, moisturizing or slenderizing body wraps, hair removal techniques such as waxing  and hand/foot treatments to rejuvenate the skin. A variety of treatments and products are used to protect skin from environmental hazards and combat fine lines, wrinkles, and a dull, uneven skin tone. Estheticians are also skilled in managing conditions such as acne, rosacea, eczema, and dry skin, to name just a few. And finally, skin care treatments are wonderfully relaxing and rejuvenating. If smooth, healthy skin is your goal, visiting a skin care professional can benefit you Visiting an esthetician It is always a good idea to schedule a consultation appointment prior to your first treatment, especially if you are new to esthetic treatments. This gives you and your therapist a chance to discuss your goals and expectations for the first visit, and long term goals for the future. During a consultation, your therapist will go over an extensive intake form, and most likely do a cleansing of the skin followed by a detailed skin analysis. This will give your therapist the information she/he needs to create an individualized treatment plan, both for a series of professional treatments and recommendations for products you can use at home. What about home care? Much of the success of maintaining a visible improvement after treatment depends on consistent, correct home care. Your esthetician is trained to select the products that will most benefit your skin, and to advise you on how to maintain your professional results between visits. Like medical or dental care, following the right daily regimen at home is essential if you are to get the most out of your visits to a professional. Your esthetician Your skin care treatments should be provided by a properly trained professional. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask your skin care therapist about her background, training, and experienceâ€”especially as it relates to the treatment you are considering. Your therapist is a professional member of Associated Skin Care Professionals. Our members have been validated as meeting their stateâ€™s licensing credentials and/or core training requirements, and agree to follow a code of ethics which ensures youâ€™ll be treated responsibly and with the utmost respect    making certain youâ€™ll receive the most up-to-date therapies available.  The Staff at diet detox wellness spa holds up they,s core values as license profesionals. it important to book your treatments at least  once a month to maintain healthy glowing skin with the right home care  system which balance your natural PH in your skin, or detox your system 3-5 times a year to be a healthy you.  book in today call 515-991-0481 by appointment.  Be Pampered and relaxed with your personal  skincare esthetician.

He has an easygoing personality, is fair to both parties, and does a good job helping couples to come to an understanding that is less confrontational, more of a journey. I could not recommend anybody better for a relationship that could use some shoring up and a shared vision/ destination."" - Travis C. ""If you are looking to enhance your relationship this is a very good workshop to take. Getting married or being in a committed relationship prior to marriage takes effort on both sides. Having the right tools and knowing many of the right questions to ask yourself and that special person you are with can make a huge difference.

People who love TV shows, sports, movies and music call Masterpiece Home Theater. The Movie Lover’s Choice If you want a TV wall-mounted, a soundbar installed or a home-theater-in-a-box system setup, there's a myriad of 'home theater specialists' you could call. But if you want home entertainment that will thrill you – night after night, month after month for years to come, Masterpiece Home Theater is the company you call. Our unbridled passion combined with unrivaled expertise is the perfect recipe for jaw-dropping home theater. Home Theater was Meant to be Immersive Home Theater technology was developed with one goal: to immerse you in the story, allowing you to forget your day-to-day troubles and get caught up in what's happening on the screen. If your home theater system wasn't designed to fully leverage that technology, you're just ""watching TV"". Ease of Use is Paramount No one likes to switch back and forth between 4 or 5 remotes. If your system is frustrating or cumbersome to control, you may be less likely to use it. Our ""One Button Simple"" remotes are precisely that. Want to watch TV? Press the ""Watch TV"" button – everything else is automatic, from what gets turned on/off to the input selections, video mode, audio mode, even dim the lights and draw the curtains. No Dedicated Theater Room Required If you have a room that can be dedicated to home theater, that\’s terrific. We can certainly work with that and there are typically fewer limitations. Integrating home theater functionality, seamlessly and unobtrusively, into a multi-purpose room is trickier, and calls for some creativity – but it\’s one of our specialties. Technology doesn\’t have to dominate the room; in fact, it can be virtually invisible. ""One of the 10 best home theater designers in the country."" — AudioVideoBuyersGuide.com Affordable Excellence. Elegant Precision. Blissful Simplicity. Extraordinary Performance. Profoundly Entertaining. These are the hallmarks of a Masterpiece Home Theater. Call now for a free consultation - (520) 955-8399 About Us Get to know Southern Arizona's premier home theater designer AUTHORITATIVE CREATIVE PASSIONATE ACCOMPLISHED INSPIRED Masterpiece Home Theater designs immersive home theater systems using the same standards and criteria used in the best commercial cinemas... Surprisingly affordable... No dedicated theater room required. Immersive Home Theater Design Multi-Room Audio/Video Elegantly Simple Control Systems Home Automation OUR TEAM Meet Southern Arizona's Very Best Home Theater Design Team Don Ferris President and Chief Designer Don has been working with home theater since the late 70s. He was there for the birth of the LaserDisc (predecessor to CD, DVD and Blu-ray), Hi-Fi VCR and Dolby Surround Sound. With over 35 years experience, Don is one of a handful of elite home theater experts in the U.S. Krista Leigh Office Manager and Customer Service Specialist Chris Chandler Installer/Tech Ed Lopez Installer Testimonials We had Don set up two theater systems in our home, plus he helped with a networking problem we experienced after buying an XBoxONE. Don is incredibly smart, ethical, hard working, on time and on budget – every time. He listens, never pitches, and always gives you great options to choose when creating a system. I’ve never had this kind of service from any contractor or service provider. We have one number for all of our home entertainment and networking needs, and it’s Don’s. He really IS that good. Craig F. Tucson, AZ Don is incredibly smart, quick in assessing problems, diligent and honest. He quickly diagnosed and explained the problem with our old TV. The repair wasn’t cost effective (even with the budget rates of the TV repair guy that Don uses) so we purchased a new TV from Don and had him install it. When the new TV turned out to be faulty, Don got the manufacturer to replace it – even though it was outside their normal time period for doing so. He would not charge us for his time on the phone and came back a few times to make sure the TV was working. Later we bought one of Don’s “1 button” remote controls. (Yes, it really is that simple!) It wasn’t cheap, but it was worth every penny and I don’t know how we ever got by without it! Lois G Tucson, AZ We live in a relatively small home and our living room wasn’t well-suited for any sort of home theater system. Or so we thought… But Don Ferris saw things we didn’t and gave us some very creative options to consider. When Don says that Masterpiece Home Theater specializes in creating unobtrusive home theater systems in multi-purpose rooms, he’s not just blowing smoke! Our living room looks like a cozy place to just sit and chat. You wouldn’t even know we have a home theater in there until we press “Watch a Movie” on Don’s 1-button magic remote! Then the screen drops down, the projector turns on, and all the components in the media closet come to life. The picture and sound are just fantastic! We much prefer our home theater to the big multiplexes. Joy F Sahuarita, AZ Before meeting with Don Ferris of Masterpiece Home Theater, we had planned on getting 3 or 4 quotes, but after meeting with the second home theater designer, it was clear that Don was in a league of his own. Aside from being so pleasant and personable, Don is just incredibly knowledgeable. He explained a lot of technical stuff (using terminology we could understand) and explained why it was important. The installation was not without it’s unexpected glitches, but Don and company handled everything confidently and he stuck to his quoted price in spite of the extra time these problems cost him. Now that it’s finished, there’s no doubt in my mind that our home theater system is so very impressive in large part due to Don’s expertise. Our friends can’t believe it! They are so impressed, Don is already working with 2 of them to work his magic in their homes! John M San Diego, CA We called Masterpiece Home Theater when we wanted a “whole home” music system. Don was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and ever so nice. The thing that impressed us most was Don’s focus on content options, not just “the system”. He introduced us to some cool options that have been worth their weight in gold! Don explained a few different options for our music system, with pricing from budget to semi-extravagant. The semi-extravagant option (with invisible speakers that are literally part of the wall) was very tempting and actually very reasonably priced for what it was – but in the end we felt it was a little too much construction, so we went with the next level down. The system works effortlessly and has been completely trouble-free. Surprisingly affordable, too! We’ve gotten so much enjoyment out of it that it would have been worth twice what we paid. David A. Marana, AZ I can’t recommend Masterpiece Home Theater enough! We talked to 2 or 3 other companies and Don was clearly the most knowledgeable by far. The fact that he was also the cheapest was just awesome. He delivered a much, MUCH better system than we thought we were going to get while staying within our budget. Charles C. Tucson, AZ ""I never imagined..."" ""Our friends can't believe it!"" ""Spectacular! Way exceeded my expectations..."" ""So simple my four-year-old can use it!"" Ready to get started?

I left there with a sense of relief! Dr. Sue, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the time you spent with us last night. I left there with a sense of relief!

It combines lyrical knowledge, spiritual wisdom and that ‘feel good’ vibe that went along with earlier hip-hop of the 90’s. As a self-taught producer/artist born and raised in Gainesville, Fla. currently residing in Jacksonville, Fla., singing in church choirs to sneaking into older brother’s rooms to listen to the likes of Goodie Mob, OutKast, Dead Prez and many others, unfamiliarity with different tones of music was never a factor. From doing rap shows in high school, mixing/sampling beats at an early age from cassette tapes to downloading some of the earlier versions of fruity loops now known as FL Studio, genre variety, and various styles emphatically helped mold what kStarMusiK is today. ​Contact Me Name * Email * Copyright © 2017 · kStarMusiK · 14701 Bartram Park BLVD Jacksonville, FL 32258 · Powered by ThriveHive <img src='http://my.thrivehive.com?noscript=1&aweid=825aae748b2a439aa54d00d0f459931f&action=PageView'/>",Music and Musicians

Check out this link for more information about Canine Influenza Virus Update: http://medicaldistrictvet.com/canine-influenza-virus-update/ Annual Pet Wellness Exams We believe in practicing preventative healthcare. To keep your pet happy and healthy, and living a long life, annual wellness exams are a must. At these visits, we can assess their overall health and possibly detect any issues or ailments before they become a major problem. We can also discuss proper pet care, and you can address any concerns or ask questions you might have. Senior Pet Care Just like with humans, elderly pets have special health requirements so they can continue to bring joy to their family. Annual wellness exams are incredibly necessary for older pets so we can run lab work to detect any health problems early, provide dental care, asses the overall health of your pet, and discuss the right diet for your aging animal. Contact us! * Name: * Phone : * Email: Message: Puppy and Kitten Care Just like with an older animal, young pets also have special requirements when it comes to their health and food. At your first vet visit, you can expect to discuss proper nutrition, how to house train a puppy or litter box train a kitten, and develop a vaccination plan. Spay or neutering a young pet, as well as microchipping them, is also very important. Starting the new addition of your family off right with a complete physical exam is important to them living a long, healthy life. Read Puppy Talk to learn more about important tips to giving your new puppy the proper care. Flea, Tick, Heartworm, and Intestinal Parasite Prevention Parasites such as fleas and ticks can carry harmful diseases. Prevention is the best step to ensuring your pet doesn’t contract any ailments from these nasty parasites. We recommend using Frontline and Heartgard, or you can discuss other treatment options at your pet’s first exam. Dentistry Healthy teeth and gums are a very important part of your pet’s care. We advise regular oral cleanings to keep your pet healthy. Poor dental health can not only cause various disease, but can also affect their eating. Be sure to discuss your pet’s dental care at your next vet appointment so we can teach you the right way to care for your pet’s oral health at home.

Welcome to the Home of Quality Painting We Exist to Serve You ​​EXPERT PAINTING SERVICES BBB Accredited The “ Timplex Difference” can be summed up in one sentence, because: My service is held to a quality standard, and never to an hourly objective. My Services Include, Interior Painting, Exterior Painting, Pressure Washing, Paint or Wall Texture Removal, and Wood staining. I feel that painting is just not any service that you should buy from the lowest bidder. So, I started my own company knowing that I was ready to serve at a level not found in most service providors these days. I often get customers who buy a home, then find other issues wrong with the house, such as electrical outlets, or plumbing fixtures not working correctly. I can usually handle all problems ‘on the fly’ before the painting is even completed. This builds a value of trust, and easily extends to a long lasting relationship. So, “Who can you really trust to do an expert job, inside of your home, while you may be at work or out of town?” ( -a salesman, who sends out a crew, OR, a clean, professional painter that owns his business and does all his own work? ) Now, you know, YOU have come to the right place! I personally handle Interior Painting or Exterior Painting Using Roller, Brush, or Sprayer. And, I know how to prepare surfaces, prime, and use the right material for the right job. So, When your home comes into need of a fresh coat of paint, it does not matter if you need exterior paint or interior paint, your primary concern is to get someone who gives your project the attention it deserves! BBB accredidation may be verified by clicking: BBB: Timplex, LLC ​​ You only need to know one thing, Timplex Painting has got you covered!

Start now! Schedule a Keynote Don’t just sit there! Coaching for Your Team Increase your Sales! Learn How “The 6 Steps” Grows Business The Commitment Tip: MAKE A FULL COMMITMENT TO YOURSELF, YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE. Passion is the essence of commitment, but do your market research to determine the viability and pathway to sales. Know your talents, strengths and differences as compared to your competition Case Study: An attorneyÂ was passionate about working with many markets including:Â families with children, gay couples, divorced couples and elder law, but she couldn’t find her ideal market or generate enoughÂ business. She made a commitment to focus on oneÂ target client for 30 days. She chose families with children. Determining who they were, led her to understandÂ where they were located and how toÂ reach them. The Outcome: By making a commitment to pick aÂ target market, she not only landed a number of families asÂ clients but also landed numerous speaking engagements in front of the right fit audience.Â  Before the end of one of her first meetings with a client, this attorney was asked to work with the client’s elder mother. This example shows that making a commitment to one market does not mean saying “no” to potential clients, but rather, focusing on one market may help lead you to other markets. The Focus Tip: MOVE FROM CHAOS TO PRODUCTIVITY. Knowing how to prioritize and make each day effective is crucial to the success of a business. Case Study: A day in the life of a small business owner or entrepreneur can be so incredibly overwhelming.Â  As great a tool as technology is, we find ourselves surfing, tweeting, face booking, and not necessarily operating in a strategic fashion.Â  For years, we have taken tremendous pride in seeing ourselves as multi-taskers, but we have found that in todayâ€™s world, multitasking does not work. We must have a razor focus on systems and structures for building revenue. The Outcome: Often people ask us about time management and though there will never be enough hours in the day, we believe it is much less about time management and much more about self -management. Focused daily results means that you no longer turn around, look at the clock, and say to yourself â€œWow, its 4pm, what happened to my day?â€� or look at your bank account at the end of the month and say, â€œWow, where is my revenue?â€�Â  At the end of the day, there must be solid answers for what you sold, developed, delivered and collected. The Differentiating Tip: CREATE YOUR MAJOR SELLING ADVANTAGE AND MARKETING MESSAGE Different than a unique selling proposition or an elevator speech but a statement that answers the questions â€œWho do you work with?â€� and â€œWhat do you do for them?â€� It should lead people to say â€œHow do you do that?â€� Case Study: A Mary Kay consultant was really struggling with creating a strong client base. It seemed to her whenever she introduced herself as a Mary Kay consultant people tuned her out even before she had the chance to make a strong connection. By helping her to determine that her ideal client was a young professional woman, we created a differentiating statement for her to introduce herself.Â  “My name is___ and I work with young professional women who want to improve their personal and professional appearance” The Outcome: Later that week when she attended a networking event, she ended up having the best experience she ever had when she had been out selling. Â She was able to have meaningful conversations that were generated from the new statement. People were intrigued, the new statement lead to the question “really, how do you do that?Â  As a result of being able to introduce herself with this statement she started using it on her sales phone calls, her website and all marketing collateral. By defining herself by who she works with and what outcome the client would receive she was able to connect with the right fit prospect. The Marketing Tip: You May Need To Test Which Methods Work For Which Market, But Once You Succeed…Just Repeat! The Case Study: Every Monday small business owners and entrepreneurs find themselves in the same situation, with little time, a minimal marketing budget, and feeling overwhelmed about finding the right strategy to get their company seen and heard.Â  The scramble begins, they make calls, tweet, blog, network, and by Friday, they are exhausted and frustrated with few results. The Outcome: We believe in the importance of looking at thirty day increments of predicted, repeatable, cost-effective, and implemental, strategic marketing plans.Â  As part of this plan you must determine how many sales calls you will make a day, what time a day you will make them, how you will record the results, and choose right fit networking opportunities, at least two every 30 days.Â  Along with these strategies, you must have a concrete social media marketing strategy and be able to track ROI.Â  By having 30-day marketing commitments, at the start of your week, all you really need to do is take a look at your marketing calendar and press send.Â  If you really track your results, in a short time you will understand what works and what doesn’t.Â  You can apply this strategy and adjust your approach based on your success rate within your targeted market The Effective Relationship Tip: MEASURE YOUR BUSINESS BY TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY Make sure you are talking to the right fit person and attend the right fit event The Case Study: Networking is an essential marketing strategy for every business owner. Clients tell us all the time “I handed out 50 business cards and no one called me,” or “I went to that event and there was no one there to meet for my business.”Â  It is very important to have a clear strategy for selling and connecting to “right fit” contacts.Â  In order to do this it is equally important to understand the difference between networking, sales and building relationships. Too often we find that small business owners are more anxious to just make the sale before building rapport and trust and ensuring they are talking to a true potential lead. The Outcome: There are 3 major factors to keep in mind when seeking connections to potential clients/ customers. Demographics:Â  This includes age, gender, location, and likes and dislikes Economics:Â  Can they pay for your services and/or products? Psychographics:Â  The client’s needs and wants match the solution, product or service you are selling. The real key to finding out if you are talking to the right person or are at the right event is to consider the factors above and to make sure you are not jumpingÂ  in and talking about yourself and your services before you have these factors sorted out.Â  The more clarity you have about who you are looking to meet, the greater likelihood that you will either meet a “right fit” client or contact, or that your conversation will result in an introduction to a “right fit” client or contact. The Manage Emotion Tip: Validate how you feel on a daily basis, but trust that everything is a process and don’t let feelings rule you. The Case Study: Managing a family and running a business is a tough combination.Â  Schedules get disrupted and vacations and budgets tend to put projects on hold. In a recent discussion with a client the other day, he voiced his frustration over how this issue had been affecting his business. He was left with a lot of anxiety and felt like he was on an emotional roller coaster. In the weeks prior, he had two promising sales meetings and had been following up with this client ever since. Unfortunately, his customer’s approval process required several different signatures and support from aÂ number of decision makers who were never on the same page and like most executives, were never in the same room at the same time. You could both feel and hear the frustration coming from this client’s voice, “Nothing is ever easy. It is like my customer just up and vanished into thin air” he said. The Outcome: It’s ok to have feelings of frustration, anxiety and disappointment. In fact, studies show that it is important for individuals to give validation to negative feelings. What is not healthy is to let these feelings dictate your mood, attitude or commitment to growing yourself or your business. We are all affected by the actions of other people: their professional faux pas, their schedules, our own families and friends, and even people we come across in the day to day-ever had someone not return your call?Â Â  Validate how you feel on a daily basis, but trust that it is a process and that the feelings and emotions are part of it and don’t let them rule you. Emotions can derail us, so it is important to stay focused and not be overcome by our emotions or be distracted by situations around us. The Accountability Tip: Know What Is Working and Build On It And Change What Isnâ€™t The Case Study: Having a system of accountability in your business is the pathway to success.Â  If you can understand how you were able to achieve a result, then you can find a way to repeat it.Â  How you account for those results, even if those results turn out to be not so positive, will provide you with information to make better decisions moving forward. A system of accountability works well in a small business or in an entrepreneurial environment because it recognizes that each person is a major contributor or has the potential to be one. To build an accountability culture and policy it is important to build a systematic method that defines expected time frames (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annually) and clearly defined roles, responsibilities and expectations.Â  Depending on the size of your company, having a conversation that usually starts with the question, â€œHow do you account for that?â€� can work as an effective system of accountability, but in order to be effective, the conversation must clearly define goals, opportunities, obstacles and responsibilities. The Outcome: By seeing accountability as more than a means of having to be responsible and productive and viewing accountability as a tool for success, you can actually keep morale high, motivate employees and ultimately can move the company as well as individuals toward high and performance and a very successful business!

Name * Phone Email * Custom Work Request Details * About As a Rhode Island School of Design graduate in Interior Design, working in the field for more than twenty years, I have an uncompromising ability to use textures, colors, shapes and materials in captivating combinations. Each piece evokes compliments and conversation. My jewelry is an expression of the influences and experiences in my life. Extensive travel throughout Europe and Asia and my love of art, in its many forms, exposed me to a broader view of the world ! This vision is translated through the use of fresh water pearls , jaspers, agates and semi-precious stones. Architectural structures and their interior details influence my choices in selecting the style, shape, and combinations of these materials. A lifelong love of art with an emphasis on Japanese woodblock prints, Chinese scroll paintings, Art Nouveau and the Art Deco movements have heavily influenced the construction, rhythm, color and design of the pieces created. When designing, great care is taken in selecting the materials. The chosen stones and pearls must be an interesting combination but not in competition. The focal point stone should create a pleasant harmony. The patterns in jaspers and agates are reminiscent of the mountains of Japan, the Great Wall of China, the castles of Europe and the oceans of the world.

VITALITY COACHING: Together we'll uncover your best path to success Let’s Do It ! Re * Imagine What’s Possible. Ladies, are you ready to supercharge your life? Somehow I just can’t buy into what society would have us to believe about decline being part of mid-life… that it’s time to settle for low energy, being overweight and living with the aches & pains we associate with aging. Nope. I believe the body is simply telling us something. It’s time for a recharge. We are heading into an exciting new life stage – a time of greater meaning, contribution, and fulfilment! It’s time to release the baggage in mind & body that have been weighing us down, literally. And more importantly, it’s time to find that soul food that brings us vibrantly alive and tapped into the abundant supply of natural energy around us all the time. How? Get ready to create VITALITY from the inside out. RE*VITALIZE YOUR BODY Choose a 32-day or 90-day program to uplevel your body and your energy. How would it be to feel fully charged and alive? VITALITY CIRCLES Enjoy the support of this small group wellness coaching with a fun factor, affordably priced. VITALITY COACHING Create a personalized action plan and boost your results with these private 1-on-1 packages or a half-day jumpstart session. Sustainable results with a whole-person approach: Our bodies are amazing and we can tap into endless natural energy when we nourish all aspects of our selves — that means the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual parts of who we are. THE PHYSICAL YOU The Physical You is nourished when you eat wholesome foods, move in ways that are joyful to your body and get plenty of deep, restful sleep. THE EMOTIONAL YOU The Emotional You is nourished when you release judgment and unprocessed emotional garbage and allow yourself to feel and express your emotions openly. Be free to live, love and laugh more. THE MENTAL YOU The Mental You is nourished with self-supportive thoughts and beliefs.  It’s an empowering shift to consciously choose how you want to show up in the world vs. how you think others would like you to be. THE SPIRITUAL YOU The Spiritual You is nourished when you trust your inner knowing and cultivate connection to something bigger than yourself. You come truly alive when you begin to make progress toward something that brings you true meaning and joy. What you’ll find is that this becomes an inward journey to wholeness and happiness — a new paradigm that will give you a sense of optimal wellness, greater energy and more vitality for life! With the Vitality Code, it’s a Simple 2-Step Approach: Step 1 Take Out The Things That Don’t Support Your Health. Step 2 Put In The Things That DO! People Love this Sensible MIND-BODY Approach : This isn’t a diet, it’s a way of living more intentionally where you can consciously create habits to bring you greater energy, vitality and longevity. This path is reasonable and sustainable for the rest of your life. Greg Dyer What I love about this is that it’s not a diet, it’s a commitment to a healthier way of living! Brooke Imagine this. Rather than having just food and exercise as our primary sources of energy… what if we had 12 different ways to create energy? When we start first by tapping into our gifts and talents and consciously create a life based on meaning and purpose, we tap into a well-spring of energy that is endless.

Get Started Contact Us Get In Touch Provide Us With Your Contact Information Name * Address * Phone * Email * County of your residence * County where the decedent resided at the time of death * Georgia Probate Manager, LLC Georgia Probate Manager, LLC is a company that is in business to assign our clients an experienced attorney who can assist a family who has recently lost a loved one with Probate or Administration if the decedent had no will and or Years Support. Probate, Administration of Estates and other legal matters dealing with the death of a loved one may be complicated and should be handled by experienced Probate Attorneys. If you need the assistance of an experienced attorney please complete the contact information and provide the information regarding the deceased loved one. The founding member of GPM is Anthony Kirkland, a licensed Georgia attorney who has been in business for more than 37 years and has assisted clients with the legal processes of Probate, administration of an estate and the filing of Petitions for Years Support. Probate means literally ""to prove"" the last will and testament of the recently deceased individual. To probate in Solemn Form all heirs at law must be identified and served with the Petition to Probate or such individuals may consent or acknowledge their consent and waive any objections to the will. Heirs who do not consent must be served in accordance with the law. Once all heirs have been legally served the Probate court will issue Letters Testamentary and administration of the estate will begin. In general, all debts of the decedent must be paid prior to the distribution of assets. Administration is a legal process used by persons who die without a will and to initiate this process all heirs at law must be identified and served in accordance with the law. The law determines who will serve as the Administrator. After an administrator is appointed by the Court the process of identifying assets and payment of debts will begin. Years Support is a legal process a spouse and or minor children may file to take all or a portion of an estate and avoid most all debts with the exception of State of Georgia income taxes, court fees, expenses of a funeral home and attorney fees. In addition to the legal processes of Probate, Administration and Years Support, Georgia law also allows legal proceedings for No Administration Necessary that may be used is there is no last will and testament and all heirs at law are in agreement as to the division of assets and all debts have been paid.

I have built my business on a few core values; knowing all aspects of the programs and products that we offer, always under-promise and over-deliver, and most importantly, always treat everyone with honesty and integrity. Those core values have allowed my Realtor and business partner relationships to thrive. I have been married to my wife Joleigh for over 10 years and we have 2 wonderful children, Caleb and Addison. I spend as much time as possible with my family and friends. Anything that we can do together, especially outdoor activities, is time well spent. Some of my favorite activities are camping, fishing, and watching my son play football while my daughter cheers on his team. I look forward to assisting you with your future mortgage needs.

We are here to fight for your rights and to represent you in a manner that obtains the best possible outcome for our clients. Bankruptcy - Chapters 7 & 13 Bankruptcy is a very scary term to most people and completely misunderstood by even more. Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy or chapter 13 bankruptcies is by no means giving up, instead you’re giving yourself a fresh start. Most people do not see bankruptcy as it is, a financial tool to provide you the resources to get your life back on track with a fresh start. Every clients financial situation is different, which is why we will determine which chapter under the US bankruptcy code would best suit your particular financial situation and afford you the best possible outcome. Family Law - Divorce, Child Custody & Support Family Law issues such as divorce, child custody and child support, can be very difficult issues to face and even harder to win without the right legal representation. This area of law demonstrates that one size does not fit all, depending on your particular situation you may require the use of it attorney simply to draft up your documents if the two parties are being civil and cooperative with each other, there is no reason for high legal fees in such a situation, and we have an attorney on staff to handle such a situation. But if you’re in a position that you need an attorney to fight for your rights, we have a different attorney that is focused primarily on litigation of such matters. There is no reason for you to pay high legal fees in Family Court if both parties can cooperate, but if you need an attorney that will fight for your rights, we have the staff to handle that situation and anything in between. Personal Injury - Accidents, Malpractice, Dog Bites Personal Injury is a specialized area of law in which we represent our clients interests, after they’ve been hurt by another or her on another’s property. Our three primary focus areas in personal injury law are automobile accidents, medical malpractice and injuries occurring on another’s property. You need a law firm that is willing to fight the insurance companies and other law firms for a settlement that will place you in the best financial position possible, after you have been harmed by another. At the Botelho Law Group, you will not be just another file, instead you’ll be matched with a specific attorney and staff to handle your matter from beginning to end. The larger personal injury law firms are simply working off of volume and wish to settle your case as quickly as possible, usually not in your best interest. At the Botelho Law Group we will fight to get everything that you deserve. Estate Law- Planning, Wills & Trusts Estate Planning, such as Wills, Trusts and complex Estate Planning is something that most people do not think about until it’s too late. Getting the right estate planning attorney is critical in protecting the assets you have worked a lifetime for into a sure that when you pass, those assets are passed on to the family and friends of your choosing. Criminal Law - Misdemeanors, Felonies, Infractions Criminal Law is a very litigation intensive area of law and requires an experienced attorney, who knows the court system and the rules of law at to best represent you in these matters. Good people sometimes make mistakes, those mistakes shouldn’t define the rest of your life. With the representation of a experienced criminal law attorney, you are assured the best possible representation in the best possible outcomes in these difficult situations. Social Security Law - Benefits & Disability Social Security Law is a very complicated and mainly understood bureaucratic process of obtaining money due to you for your particular disability through the Social Security Agency. Most people attempt to file for Social Security benefits themselves, and up to 75% of those are denied. Compared to the 85% of people who apply for Social Security benefits with the representation of an experienced attorney are accepted and given Social Security benefits. If you’re either filing for the first time or filing an appeal, have an experienced Social Security attorney representing you, will give you a much higher chance of success in obtaining your benefits. Immigration Law - Green Cards, Citizenship & Visas Immigration Law is a specialized practice in which lawyers help those from foreign countries obtain a green card, a visa to remain in the country for educational purposes or to work and even to obtain citizenship to the United States. Depending on your particular situation, it is always best that you consult with an experienced immigration attorney before you plan on moving to the United States, and even more important if you have already done so and are seeking to stay. At the Botelho Law Group, we have experienced immigration attorneys on staff to handle all your immigration needs. Business Law - Planning, Protection, Liability & Legal Matters Business Law can be very complicated to those just starting out in business or even those with established businesses. The first step should always be starting either a limited liability company or corporation, which will afford the business owner personal security for their assets and wealth and protect them from any type of litigation that may befall their company. Many people do not realize how financially dangerous it is to run a business, any business, without the protection of forming its own business entity. At the Botelho Law Group we will help you choose the best business entity for your particular business and financial needs. We can also help you through any legal situation that your business may be confronted with in the future. Land Lord & Tenant Law Landlord – Tenant Law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are some of the strictest laws in the country in this practice area. It is critical to have an experienced attorney representing you in matters such as evictions and other situations pertaining to the landlord-tenant relationship.

P ARENT COORDINATON A Parent Coordinator is often helpful when parents have difficulty sharing decisions in stressful situations. CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE. ABOUT PATTI HOLT My Story A long time ago, I introduced my best friend to a wonderful man. They wed four years later.  Unfortunately, after fourteen years of marriage, and three children, the marriage fell apart.  The husband filed for divorce, locked my friend out of the marital home, emptied the bank account, accused her of child abuse, completely alienated her from one son, and attempted to ruin her career.  The divorce procedure, involving lengthy psychological evaluations of all family members, took over five years to work its way through the court system and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees alone.   About the time her divorce was ending, I realized my own marriage was over.  Having watched my friend go through this terrible ordeal, I asked my husband to agree that we would not follow the same path  and we didnt.  Although the process was painful, we stayed out of court, negotiated a settlement with the help of a mediator, and came up with a marital settlement agreement that met both of our needs, and more importantly, the needs of our children. Although we no longer live in the same area of the country, we are now good friends and talk frequently, especially about our kids. I share this story in part to give you hope, but more importantly to provide an insight into my philosophy of family practice.  I was a litigation attorney for many years, but I am now trying to focus on helping couples and families navigate through the often rough waters of divorce with the assistance of mediation, collaborative practice, and parent coordination.  I have experience working with all ages, ethnicities and the LGBTQ community.  Please call or send me an email if you are interested in exploring whether a gentle approach to separation and divorce might work for you and your situation. MY BACKGROUND I obtained a nursing degree from Emory University and practiced as a nurse for several years in the fields of pediatrics, emergency care, cardiology, infertility and hospice care.  I then worked my way through law school at UNC Chapel Hill, attending classes by day and working evening and night shifts in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at UNC Hospital.  Upon graduating, I began practice with the litigation firm of Yates, McLamb and Weyher in Raleigh and later started my own practice.  I enjoyed working as a trial attorney and medical-legal consultant throughout the state of North Carolina for almost twenty years before my family moved to California, where I developed a stronger interest in alternative dispute resolution, concentrating on issues involving children and families.  I am happy to have returned home to North Carolina where I now help clients find better solutions that work to the mutual benefit of individuals, couples and family members. I enjoy helping clients navigate through conflicts and crisis involving all stages of life, from infertility to adolescence issues to divorce to hospice care.

YOUNG COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADS: Â THEIR FUTURE'S SO BRIGHT....THEY OUGHTA WEAR SHADES!!!! Â It has definitely been more than several years since I myself took that long awaited walk with my classmates in our caps and gowns, to get our well deserved (or not so well deserved) high school diplomas.Â  You could feel the energy of all these highly pumped up teens, some with such great plans for their futures and others who just planned on going to the beach everyday that summer.Â  Nonetheless, we were all on top of the world! My home is situated about 2 blocks from the local high school and this is the one time of year that we actually enjoy all the parking and activity that takes place at the end of the school year!Â  Families, flowers, balloons, cameras, conversations of dinner plans, party plans, etc... Then there are those kids who are going all out to leave one last impression by wearing an over-sized hat, a boa, a crazy over-sized necktie or whatever they can find to leave that lasting memory and make their very last day unforgettable.Â  I remember there being kids like this at my own graduation day!Â  We moved to this neighborhood when my son was only 3 years old, and this year, YOU GUESSED ITâ€¦he will be joining his friends and classmates as they graduate from this high school as the Class of 2017!!Â  So bitter-sweet and so very proud! I recently sold three pairs of shades to someone for a graduation gift for their daughter and her two best friends to do their final high school walk!!Â  They custom ordered these to be made with their school colors and are apparently quite the hit already!!Â  It's this kind of flamboyance that I love to see from these young, bold, confident and eager young adults that fully comprehend that the world is their oyster and their future is SOOO BRIGHT!!Â  I only hope they remember to add a fabulous hat and magnificent boa to their fabulous shades! ALL THE BEST TO THE CLASS OF 2017!!!Â MAY YOUR DAYS ALWAYS BE SUNNY AND BRIGHT!!! Â February 08, 2017 HIGH FASHION SENIORS ADVANCED FASHION STYLES FOR WOMEN OF ALL AGES! When I think of fashion style for Â senior citizens, I often think of the seniors that Iâ€™ve known in my own life Â which of course would include my grandparents, inlaws and those of my Â friends. Sensible shoes, nice blouse, Â a complimentary skirt or slacks, usually some sort of crochet or knitted scarf, hat and/or sweater, and of course their eyewear was usually just simple, basic frames because they were a necessity, seldom because they added flair or fun to their already SENSIBLE fashion style. Lately, Iâ€™ve been doing some research on fashions of women over 55 and Iâ€™ve discovered that there is this whole cluster of seniors not dressing like the seniors Iâ€™ve come across too often!!! These women are hip and fashion forward!! ITâ€™S ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING TO ME!! These women are wearing fabulous hats, jeans, tennis shoes, boots, layers, boas, bright combinations, elegant dresses, lots of accessories and minimal accessories, hair styles are modern and sometimes wildly colored, and YESâ€¦OH YES, they are going all out in the eyewear department!!! Â  Â Some of them are not only still employed, but employed as FASHION MODELS!! Did I mention that I was fascinated by all of this??!! These women seem to be enjoying their golden years with all the gusto, color and style they can muster!! Â  Â Â Iâ€™ve saved a Pinterest page called High Fashion Seniors because I love what I see!! People often ask me, if my unique line of eyewear will look fine on women over the age of 55 since all my models are between ages 20â€™s to 40â€™s. While these seniors may not be wearing my glasses in these photos, I can comfortably say, â€œYESâ€� my line of eyewear will look terrific on women of ALL AGES!!!

If you're new to yoga or haven't done it in a while, keep in mind that yoga is very individual and personal.  While we are all doing the same poses (stretches) in a yoga class, we won't all look the same because everyone is built different with variations in height, bone structure, range-of-motions, and fitness levels - so be patient with yourself.  I can show you how to adapt yoga to you, rather than trying to adapt to a stereotypical image of what yoga ""should"" look like. That's the beauty of yoga - it's all about YOU! Your yoga mat is your personal space where you get to create an awareness about your body, challenge yourself, synchronize your breath and movement, gain strength & flexibility, and ease into each asana (yoga pose) without competition or judgement. If you've been doing yoga for a while, keep at it! There's always a new way of understanding your body, a next level to achieve, a new variation to a pose you've done many times. A yoga practice is always evolving!

775,"Media Peel | Business, Technology, Health, News, & Media Media Peel Business, Technology, Health, News, & Media Home Business Technology Health Industrial Creative Where to Convert Camcorder Tapes to DVD? Posted 	on July 21, 2017 With emerging technology making old video recording devices obsolete, there’s been an increased need to convert camcorder tapes to DVD and other digital formats. We as humans love preserving memories. And unfortunately most of these memories remain on outdated video tapes. So now more than ever, people are looking for the optimal solution to convert camcorder tapes to DVD for easier accessibility as well as lasting preservation. Old school technology like this is hard to come by. Take the time to convert old video tapes to DVD to enjoy old memories for years to come. Remember those camcorder video cameras your parents (or grandparents) used to capture birthday parties and Christmas gatherings? Just a few decades ago, that was the only way to capture video. Most people have stacks and stacks of VHS and video tapes still sitting at home and gathering dust. This is the perfect time to take the bull by the horns and convert VHS tapes to DVD and digital files before those tapes get too old or lost. At the moment it might seem like a trivial thing to do, but as people get older, these memories become more and more precious. There are three main ways to convert camcorder tapes to DVD, so whichever you choose is strictly up to you and your personal preferences. Camcorder Tape Formats and Dilemmas Back in the day, all camcorder recording was done on tape. Bigger tapes like VHS, then – smaller ones. 8mm and Hi8 were the popular video formats before the tapeless recording became available. There was never enough space on the tapes and there was always the dilemma of keeping footage and recording something over it. That was before memory cards and smartphones. However, now the problem is playing them back and converting them to DVD format. Since most people have never done anything like this, they should consider specialized shops that have the equipment and experience to convert camcorder tapes to DVD, such as Current Pixel , a reputable store with local roots in Atlanta, Georgia. They understand the importance of preserving and re-creating family memories, and converting old tapes is one of the best ways. You will need to leave your tapes at the shop and allow the elves do the magic, but it is also to your convenience. When you have professionals helping you, you will get the best quality DVD in the end (of course, depending on the quality of the core material) as well as the tapes back if you want to keep them. This means you don’t have to spend time doing this at home and you can pick up your DVDs and have a family get-together to watch them on your DVD player or laptop. Where to Transfer Video Tapes? Using a professional video transfer service is an investment. You might think that it is too expensive, so the alternative places this service can be performed are some of the big brands. Walmart also offers select video transfer services as does Walgreens, but when they don’t specialize in all camcorder formats. In the end you get DVDs or digital files, but it is way better to pay more for a professional video transfer service. For people who like to do things like this at home, you can do it with one of the specialized video tape converter machines. However, you might run into the same issue again. Quality. If you want the top quality product in the end, you will have to buy expensive equipment and if this is the only time you’re going to use it – is it worth it? Specialized shops will be able to determine the exact type of camcorder tapes you have, all while providing options based on your needs and budget. Convenience is another factor you have to take into account. You don’t want to be spending hours upon hours performing this task which seems like fun at the beginning, but in the end turns tedious. All in all, the best thing to do in this case is to find a specialized shop near you that will convert all the different tapes you have into digital files, copy them on a DVD or an external hard drive. Some stores offer affordable and flexible options for video transfer , helping to take all the worries off your shoulders. When it comes to converting camcorder tapes to DVD, companies like Current Pixel in Atlanta deliver robust capabilities with individualized service. They will advise you on how to best store the tapes and DVDs, and offer advice if you want to do this at home next time. Preserving family memories is a priceless thing, and not only yourself, but also your parents will definitely appreciate it. It could become an amazing gift for an anniversary or a birthday, so give it a go. Many people don’t see value in these old tapes in their grandfathers’ closet, but you can never know what kinds of hidden gems you can uncover. There are secrets on every corner. If it’s done right and it’s done with love – that will be kept in family for years and years to come, shown to the kids, grandkids and future generations will learn from all this material.

Most golfers out there are far from good. However, most golfers are good at being mindful of the greens and repairing divots. The Mark Mender is a new divot repair tool that makes huge, embarrassing divots a thing of the past. As a golfer, you may have heard that to properly repair divots, you should push the grass in rather than pull towards you with your divot tool. The Mark Mender does this automatically with one press. This tool is simple and very easy to use. You simply place the four prongs around the divot and squeeze. Alakazam! The divot vanishes and the putting green is restored. Why The Mark Mender Among Divot Repair Tools? Most golfers understand that know how to fix a divot with an average mark fixer or even a golf tee. But even the Golf Channel agrees that the Mark Mender does the most consistent job. Most golfers usually use their finger to push back on the bump that occurs when the ball strikes the green. After, golfers can then pinch the sides of the divot crater together with the Mark Mender. A day or two later, the green is completely healed. The Mark Mender makes amends for golf greens and serve as a highly-effective divot repair tool with a sturdy, quality feel. The tool is made of a high-quality zinc alloy and feels great to hold in the hand. The material seems slicker than most would expect. What most golfers like about the tool is you can clip it on your belt and it even comes with a cool ball marker. After most golfers who use the Mark Mender experience the tool’s quality, they soon realize why it is far superior than any other divot repair tools on the market. If only it made hackers better a golfing. At the very least, the Mark Mender can help golfers who to try to fix ball marks with a regular tool and struggle as a result. You know, the type of golfers who should almost leave their ball marks alone rather than tear up the green trying to fix them. But with the Mark Mender, the technique is built-in, requiring effortless divot repair. And since Mark Mender is so easy and satisfying to use, golfers may tend to not only fix their own golf ball mark on greens, but at least one other every time they’re analyzing their putt. More Than Just a Divot Repair Tool In short, we recommend this tool to any avid golfer. The Mark Mender is something that every golfer needs to have in his pocket. And the next thing every golfer needs to buy is a hat clip ball marker, but that’s a different product altogether. But not with the Mark Mender. Most users of the Mark Mender divot repair tool also like to use it to prop-up the handle of my putter while I’m chipping (or vice versa) as the green can dewy and make the grip wet. Another bonus? The Mark Mender is also a nifty cigar holder. So if you’re the type of golfer who enjoys a good stogie while out on the course, then the Mark Mender is definitely for you. Just about everybody you hit the links with will ask to try it. The Mark Mender divot fixer is a terrific product and makes for a great gift. The price is a few dollars more than other comparable divot repair tools on the market, but it’s definitely worth it. The Mark Mender actually fixes divots RIGHT by squeezing the edges of the crater together, making it even without destroying the roots. As a result, everyone gets to enjoy a perfect green, not to mention course superintendents will be pleased to see you’re restoring the greens in proper fashion.

With so many different levels of authenticity that must be proven and verified with different departments, it’s surprising and sometimes shocking that we can even make it successfully through a single day with all the interruptions we daily face. Almost unknown to those out of the medical field, doctors and nurses and other medical care professionals all are subjected to this kind of details as well. When it comes to distracting details, medical professionals are perhaps one of the most weighed down professionals out there. With every single procedure and service needing to be scrutinized and recorded so that it could later be billed through the long workaround of insurance, it is easy for doctors, especially in small practices, to become tangled up in the recording every note and detail up to proper codes and billed through the proper services. To shed light on some of the best medical billers in the U.S., Below is a list of some of the best outsourced medical billing and coding companies for medical professionals. Nue MD What they’re about: Started up in 1993, Nue MD works off of the core principle of simplification. They understand that it takes a very precise and constantly updating knowledge to keep track of which form goes where and which code takes which to be properly processed and payed up when it comes to medical billing.

The review below highlights three forms of treatment offered at Eastside Wellness Chiropractic that are designed to help individuals identify physical issues and boost overall mobility. These treatments are truly what define this practice from other Peoria Area chiropractors. Functional Movement Screen (FMS) Eastside Wellness Chiropractic in Peoria uses FMS, which is a grading and ranking system that is designed to document movement patterns that are significant to normal function. Hence, by screening the patterns, FMS identifies all functional asymmetries and functions. Furthermore, FMS is designed to produce a Functional Movement Screen Score, which is fundamental in assessing problems as well as in tracking the patient`s progress. The score obtained will direct clinical staff on the corrective exercise strategies that the patient should adopt.

Further, Cox Flexion Distraction has been identified as the best chiropractic practice that treats intervertebral disc issues using traction mobilization. Cox Flexion Distraction is a gentle, safe and very efficient chiropractic technique since it does not involve the standard practice of cracking, twisting, or popping of the patient`s spine. Active Release Technique (ART) ART is a powerful technique used to treat a broad range of functional issues and physical blockages throughout the patient`s body. Eastside Wellness Chiropractic has chosen this method has one way to release tight muscles and boost your mobility in a natural manner. ART provides a better supplement to other kinds of chiropractic adjustments. Additionally, ART is used to treat many other problems associated with muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, and fascia. All human bodies are prone to laying down scar tissues. Hence, the scar tissues will cause the body muscles to become weaker and shorter trapping tension on the tendons.

On-board scales are a simple yet advanced system which uses two transducers which are responsible for monitoring both the rod side and full side of the ram pressures. It has proximity sensors on its arm to help determine if the weighing position has already been reached. On-board weighing systems also work well in monitoring acceleration and speed. For articulated dump trucks, the Weighloader makes use of strain to be able to accurately measure the load on the machine. It can effectively ensure that payload on the machine is always at its optimum level. It avoids overloading and improves the overall process of volume load management. 3.

Scheduling time with Rich for the initial consult was pain free and he made us feel very comfortable with his low-key approach. He worked with us to pick out the right shelving, blinds and door for the project and then installed them one morning as I worked from home. Quick and painless! He also consulted with us on a number of other items on our ""to do"" list but we chose to wait on those projects and move forward with the closet and blinds only. We will consider hiring them again when we have other small/medium household projects. MATTHEW E. - NATICK, MA These guys are amazing and I'd highly recommend them. Will be calling them again for my next projects. Ed was incredibly knowledgeable so I didn't need to explain much. He knew what was needed and how to fix it. He came on time, did a great job, and was done sooner than expected. Output looks great. He forgot to do one small thing (it was a long list of items), and when we told him he came back over immediately (same day) and did it. Amazing service, and we're very happy with the kitchen as a result! JIM S. - MELROSE, MA Their work was outstanding! Rich and his crew were clearly very expert in repair work and did a terrific job in each of 3 different areas at 2 locations. They were also very responsive and completed the work in good time. I have no hesitation in recommending this company for a variety of repairs.

Something went wrong, try refreshing and submitting the form again. What We Do? RESIDENTIAL POOL CLEANING RESIDENTIAL POOL REPAIRS RESIDENTIAL POOL MAINTENANCE If you are like most people in southwest Florida, you have tried to take on the grueling task of maintaining your pool. Regular chemical checks, chemical purchases, and repairs can all become nagging pains after a while, turning the task of maintaining your pool into a taxing job. Instead of enjoying your pool on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, you are cleaning it, repairing the pump, and testing for chemical balances. We know that you want to enjoy your pool to its fullest extent, so this is why you need a service that can alleviate all the nagging concerns and allow you to enjoy one of your most prized assets. You do not need just any service though. You need a service that is experienced, personable, hard-working, and most importantly, is dedicated to your pool. There is something about Florida that makes a pool pretty much a necessity. So why not make this necessity pure enjoyment for you and your family, and let us take care of the nuisances of keeping your beloved pool crystal clean and finely tuned. Florida Pool Masters is here to make sure that you are only stepping into your backyard to enjoy your pool, and not to maintain it. What Services We Provided? Basic Services Click to learn more about our basic services. Premium Services Click to learn more about our premium services. Repairs / Installations Click to learn more about our repair and installation services. Why choose us? Worry free guarantee Forget about fluctuating water chemistry. In fact, forget about buying and lugging chemicals, troubleshooting problems, remembering to latch the gate, whether its safe to swim, or if your filter’s making a funny noise. When we leave your home, you will be worry free and know exactly what is going on with your pool. EASE OF CONTACT Unlike non-local companies, we do not send your requests to a customer service center hundreds of miles away from Southwest Florida. Your calls, online requests, and concerns are sent directly to and dealt with by me, the owner of Florida Pool Masters. We are available 12 hours plus a day (even on holidays) and respond back lightning fast. TOTAL CLEAN PROMISE “Spot Cleaning” is a dirty little practice some pool service companies use to reduce their prices. It involves picking and choosing what to clean based upon what you see. It ignores basic microbiology and flies in the face of proper pool care. OUR PRIDE IN CONSISTENCY Non-locally owned pool companies send you out a different random pool repair and maintenance crew every week! Here at Florida Pool Masters, we believe that having the same crew sent out to you weekly or bi-weekly is key to maintaining a stable pool. That crew will become yours and will know your pool inside and out. Having different and random people sent out weekly is a recipe for mix-ups and malpractice. EXPERIENCE When you choose to work with Florida pool Masters, you truly are getting the best of the best. Coming to your home will be me, the owner or a member of my experienced team who have been in this industry for years. You will never get a newbie who can’t tell a saltwater pool from a chlorine pool. Your pool will be in the hands of some of the most experienced and talented workers the Southwest Florida area has to offer. RAIN OR SHINE WE ARE THERE When your pool filter breaks down in the middle of a heat wave, or your heater goes on the fritz in the middle of winter, it makes all the difference in the world to know you’ll get help quickly. Unlike some companies that make you wait up to two weeks for servicing, we want to get your pool back to normal that same day or the next. Holidays, storms, personal events, we work through them all to ensure your needs are fulfilled lightning fast. How it works 1 Submit your service request Call us, email us, or fill our online form to get In touch with us. Tell us about your pool, the problems you have now with it, what you want us to fix/install/maintain, and your goals/visions for your pool. 2 Set Up a FREE Evaluation After you reach out to us, we will get back to you with lightning speed. The next step here is to set up a free estimate and pool evaluation session with us. Other companies charge up to 80$ for a session like this, but here at Florida Pool masters we strongly believe an introductory session should be totally free on your end, giving you peace of mind and total flexibility in your decision-making process. 3 Set Up a Game plan Following your free consultation session, it is time for us to get to work. After evaluating your pool needs, we will set up a set schedule and game plan to ensure we service your pool around your schedule giving you total assurance in knowing your pool needs will be met consistently. 4 Get Back Out There and Enjoy your Pool! Now that you have us worrying about the nitty gritty of your pool, you have more time to sit back, relax, and enjoy! Testimonials I found Greg to be extremely attentive to the pool.

787,もっと住みやすい住居に！水廻りリフォームの豆知識 もっと住みやすい住居に！水廻りリフォームの豆知識 HOME 知っておくべき水廻りリフォームの時期 洗面ユニットを自己流に水廻りリフォーム SITEMAP 水廻りのリフォームを考える際のポイント トイレ、お風呂場、キッチンなど、水廻りリフォームを考える際には、いくつかのポイントを把握することが大切になります。以下に、その一例を挙げてまとめていくことにします。 まず第一に、予算を定めその中で、可能な限りまとめて水廻りリフォームをしてしまうことが大切になります。トイレだけ、お風呂場だけのリフォームをするよりも、ある程度まとめて水廻りのリフォームをした方が、費用が安価に済む場合も多いからです。 さらに、多くの水廻りの寿命を考えると、20年前後で（もちろん使い方、メンテナンスの仕方などにもよりますが）劣化、リフォームが必要になるケースが散見されるので、時期的な要素も多分に含まれます。 また、いくつかのリフォーム業者から見積もりを取り、そのサービスや施工料金の比較検討をすることも大切になります。相応の費用を要することが多いですから、業者の見定めは慎重に行うと良いかもしれません。 以上2点が、水廻りリフォームを考える際のポイントの一例になります。私たちの暮らしの中で、人それぞれに価値観の違いはあるにしても、住みやすい住居の存在は確かに暮らしに安心感や豊かさなどをもたらしてくれるものです。水廻りのリフォームもその契機のひとつになり得るのではないかと考えられます。 水廻りのリフォームの相場について 水廻りについては、20年くらいしますとリフォームをしなければならないといわれる時期になります。そのリフォームでありますが、水廻りによってどれくらいの値段がかかるのでしょうか？ 水廻りリフォームの値段については、水廻りの場所によって変わってきます。トイレや洗面台あたりのリフォームとなりますと、おおよそ10万円から20万円くらいが相場で、かなりきれいで抜本的なリフォームとなりますと40万以上します。水廻りの中では狭いところではありますが、リフォームにお金をかけるとなりますとそれなりの値段はします。 また、キッチンやお風呂のリフォームとなりますと、更にお金がかかります。お風呂の浴槽や水廻り、キッチン付近の洗面台の入れ替えなら40万当たりで済むケースもありますが、ユニットバスを新調するケースやキッチンを大きく入れ替える場合には100万円以上かかるケースもあります。そこに腐食などがあって、その入れ替えも必要であるというようなケースであれば更にお金がかかります。 水廻りのリフォームはその他のリフォームと比べますとお金がかかるものですから、十分な予算をもってリフォームの準備をしていった方がいいと考えられます。 水廻りリフォームを一括で行えばお得に！ 水廻りリフォームというのは、何かとお金がかかりやすいものです。ほんのちょっとやるだけでも数十万円ほどかかってしまいますし、大規模になれば百万円以上というもの普通です。 ですが、そんな水廻りのリフォームについて、水廻りのリフォームを一括で行うと安く済むというのはご存知でしょうか？会社によってキッチンやおふろ、トイレ、洗面台といった水廻りの部分についてすべて一括でリフォームを行いますと、一つ一つバラバラにやるよりも安くなるプランというものがあります。 その値段の差についてですが、会社やプランなどにもよりますが、一つ一つバラバラにやるよりも、おおよそ40万円前後ほど安い値段で行えるというものです。 パックの値段も各社色々な値段の設定がされていますが、標準的な価格としてはおおよそ100万円クラスのものが多く、水廻りのリフォームの値段としてはかなり安い値段でお得なセットになっているものが主流です。プランによっては100万円を下回るリフォーム代金のものもあります。 水廻りリフォームについては、値段が高くないやすいからこそ、こういったお得なプランで一気にリフォームをすることがおすすめです。水廻りというのは、おおよそ同じ期間くらいの耐久年数であるとも言われていますので、より一括でやるメリットは大きいといえます。 RECOMMENDED ARTICLE 知っておくべき水廻りリフォームの時期 水廻りというのは毎日のように使うところであり、快適に利用をし続けていくためにはリフォームが必要不可欠な部分です。しかし、水廻りリフォームの時期がわからないという方も多いのではないでしょうか。水廻りリフォームは時期を逃してしまう… READ... 洗面ユニットを自己流に水廻りリフォーム 大阪の枚方に新築で家を建ててから20年以上経って、清潔感がなくなっていた洗面所と数年前に整髪料のボトルを落としてできた洗面ボールの小さなヒビが気になっていました。意を決して、給湯器の交換時にお世話になった水廻りリフォーム業者に… READ... 水廻りリフォームの時期について 普段の生活において、水というものは色々なところで使うものであり、私たちの生活には欠かせないものです。そんな水でありますが、水道管などの故障により生活に支障が出ると困ってしまうものです。そんな水廻りのトラブルというものはできる限… READ... 水廻りはリフォームしないとどうなる？ 水廻りリフォームを行わず、耐久年数が過ぎてしまいますと家に大きなダメージを与えたりするようなケースがあります。壁にちょっとしたひびが入っていたりして水が侵入したり、配水管が劣化により水漏れを起こしてしますと、家の柱が水により腐… READ...

It has been on my mind for some time that it would be a win-win situation for all if I put down the facts and knowledge I have acquired during these decades of study and experience. Needless repetition is avoided this way and we all win from that. It has become apparent that this compilation of the results of my studies will save the reader money that might otherwise have been spent on attorneys fees. This book contains a summarization of objective facts as well as my thinking on these matters that will be of great value to those who read it. It has become apparent that this compilation of the results of my studies will save the reader money that might otherwise have been spent on attorneys fees. Clearly a knowledgeable attorney should be hired at some point if you decide to complete the purchase of a home. I know this book will give you a firm base of knowledge that will make that attorneys job easier in that you will be such a knowledgeable partner in the business at hand that no one will think about underestimating you in any way. For advice that is specific to your own personal circumstances, you should consult your own trusted professional. This comprehensive, reliable and thorough roadmap is written for the newcomer to the process of home buying, but it is also rich in detail useful to those who already have some knowledge through their own experience and study. We are all students here and always will be. The law is constantly changing and always will change and evolve with time. Knowledge is power. The advice on maximizing your credit score is so useful and comprehensive that it alone is worth the price of the book. Regardless of whether you ultimately proceed to buy a home, you will benefit greatly from the knowledge gained by following through on what you learn from this chapter. For most people, the decision of whether or not to buy a home is the single most important financial decision they will ever make. Although choosing where you will live long term is an emotional process, that process can be quite rewarding and I have tried to keep this factor in mind. However, let it be clear that the business side of the equation must ultimately have the greater weight in all final decisions. Start by learning to think ahead, I mean really ahead and you will do just fine. The information contained in this book is for informational purposes only. There is no substitute for discussing your individual situation with your own attorney. It is my hope that your dealings with professionals will be aided by what you learn here. Lets put it together right! I will help you think it through, thats a promise.

The process of ordering flowers and getting tuxes was so easy and Becky knew exactly what I wanted. It was such a stress free process. Becky’s creativity and unique style was used in all my floral arrangements. She did the floral bouquets, bridesmaid bouquets, boutonnieres, corsages, altar centerpiece, and the rehearsal dinner centerpieces. The uniqueness of the rehearsal dinner centerpieces with lemons in the vase was completely fantastic and something that I had never seen before! My bridal bouquet was exactly what I had always wanted to walk down the aisle with. I couldn’t have asked for anything better! I was thoroughly impressed that when one of the groomsmen’s tuxes was a little off, Becky did everything she could to get that shirt in the morning of the wedding in less than 24 hours. I knew I was in great hands and never had to worry once about anything. She really made my day stress free. Becky was so timely in having everything where I needed it and it was perfect. Berry Vine Creations made my wedding day as I had always dreamt it would be. - Kristi Jones Gemmell Contact Information Berry Vine Creations 16 Main St. Arkport, NY 14807 Tel: (607) 295-9900 E-Mail: becky@berryvinecreations.com Gallery Home About Us Gift Shop Flowers Tuxedos Testimonials Contact Home About Us Gift Shop Flowers Tuxedos Testimonials Contact © 2017, Berry Vine Creations.

It would be a pleasure to work with Drew again and I'm excited to see where his unique skill set will lead him.

We don’t just help buy and sell buildings or acreage. We help people find their place in our community. When the company was founded back in 1982, the intention was to create a new kind of company, a company whose approach to real estate was built on service, approachability and a genuine understanding of our clients' needs. That approach has been good to us. In an industry known for its high turnover of staff, we're proud to say that the original partners are still with us and they are still helping people buy and sell homes, farms and land. The average length of time folks have been here is 19 years. Even our newbies look like they are going to stick around a while. We've helped people buy and sell thousands of property for thirty years, and we've even turned down many an offer from big-time real estate firms trying to merge with us. (We said no thanks. We value our independence.) BY DEFINITION, BUILDING EXPERIENCE TAKES TIME Longevity is not just good for us as a company. It's central to the service we provide our clients also. From the old-time farms of Chatham County, through the renovated mill houses of Carrboro, to the chic condos springing up downtown, we have developed a deep understanding of the land and buildings of our community and the people who inhabit them. Whether we're helping someone find their perfect homestead, or orchestrating the sale of the family home, buying or selling real estate is a monumental event in a person's life. That's why we do all we can to make the process fulfilling, stress-free, and even enjoyable. The fact that many of us count former clients among our best friends is, we would argue, a good sign that we are doing something right.

A high-vibe, heart-centered, culture of men and women who have decided to take responsibility for their life, emotions, and attitude and have committed to a lifelong adventure of spiritual growth. We are aligning our heads with our hearts to unleash the powerful and confident King’s and Queen’s that reside within us. We are using this confidence and power to create our dream life, our dream relationships and to create real heart-centered connections with people, in spite of our differences. Constantly challenging ourselves to live and love unconditionally. Jaxlyn & Maritza We are best friends, intuitives, MOMS. We are 2 outrageously PASSIONATE humans with a purpose. Maritza is a registered psychotherapist & Theta Healer, a former soldier in the US Army Reserves. Jaxlyn is a Corporate Wellness Coach, Image Consultant & Personal Trainer, currently studying Clinical Sexology. WORK WITH MARITZA Creating a sex-positive culture begins with loving yourself. I have discovered in my own life that the quality of my relationships with others depends on how I feel about myself. We crave to be with another human being but the truth is that to have an intensely satisfying and loving relationship you must first love yourself. There was a time in my life that I desperately wanted to have a relationship more than anything. When I started paying attention to myself, learned to love myself and accept fun and joy into my life, a wonderfully compatible and loving partner walked into my life. Relationships are a wonderful opportunity for growth. They stretch us to love more and to love unconditionally. They hold the space to bring everything up that is non-loving so that we can heal it. My goal is to live my life with unconditional love and to constantly strive for it. I have experienced many life lessons that have included conflicts in my relationships and it has taught me that usually, the core problem is that I have not accepted myself or my partner. Real love is acceptance, which brings peace and joy. And joy attracts your inner desires. I feel eternally grateful that I have truly loved twice. The first was naive, unconscious and as a result difficult and short-lived. After learning to love and accept myself, the second love has been mature, patient, true. It is not without its challenges, but it feels safe and genuine and I am not afraid to be myself. It feels comfortable and exciting at the same time. I am truly blessed for connections but this has been as a result of being open to connecting with myself. I invite you to join me in the journey of self-discovery, unconditional love and creating genuine relationships. With Love, BOOK NOW BOOK NOW Our Purpose: To unify the world by creating and holding space for a sex-positive culture that celebrates human sexuality & spirituality. Allowing YOU, OUR CHILDREN, and all of our brothers and sisters of the planet the same opportunity to live an empowered, happy, safe, and free life as their AUTHENTIC selves. Sexuality, Spirituality, Love, & Relationships: 4 core experiences everyone will explore throughout their lifetime and none of which come with an instruction manual. Yet, we are expected to be perfect in all of these areas of our life, most of the time without having the ability to explore who we are safely and without judgment. All of us are seeking to experience the same thing: to fulfill the highest, truest, expression of ourselves as human beings. EVERY ONE desires this in the exact same way: to have unconditional love and support flowed our way, as we develop in the way in which we see ourselves.

Our mulchers grind up everything above grade and shoot it out onto the ground.  It can be left in place to help stabilize and fertilize the soil or the mulch can be burned after it dries for quick forest to pasture.  If the wildland urban interface is getting too close to your home, we can clear the wildfire fuel and reduce it to a safe and maintainable condition. Land and lot clearing in Panama City, then to Enterprise, AL clearing privet, haul again to Tifton, GA to clear under pecan orchards and then mowing brush and trees in between rows of a pine plantation in Tallahassee all in the same week;  We travel all around North Florida, South Alabama and South Georgia so don't hesitate to ask for an estimate on your next land clearing project. This year, we've cleared understory brush and trees in Pensacola for a habitat restoration project and mowed hardwoods in Apalachicola for RCW habitat.  Forestry mowers, gyro trac machines, forestry mulchers, brush mulchers, bush hog on steroids or big green tree eating machine; it doesn't matter what you call them, just make sure you call KW Land Works to quote your next land clearing services project. Contact Us We're Social Keep Up-to-date With Us More Social Contact Us Leave Your Contact Information Below × × Submit Take Back your land Wildlife will appreciate it too! Dense thickets of volunteer pines, hardwoods or Titi brush are of little ecological use to most wildlife.  Most of the Southeastern US was maintained by natural wildfire prior to European settlement.  Early reports note the open expanses underneath old mature stands of trees.  The midstory (big bushes, small trees, etc) was non existent and the understory was kept short by semi-annual wildfire.  The fires occurred so frequently that fuel from the trees didn't have an opportunity to accumulate in significant mass thus resulting in fires of relatively low intensity.  This constant set back of the brush, vines and shrubs provides ample food for wildlife and beautiful views for onlookers. Mowing down brush and trees between the large trees might seem like an ecologically insensitive think to do but its much better for all involved than to let it keep growing.  The adult trees will grow better and live longer and the wildlife will have food growing where they can get to it, on the ground. Take back your land by having it forestry mulched.  Clearing the underbrush will look better, promote wildfire and disease resistance and increase the presence of deer, turkey, quail and the like.

Blog Blog Post: Happy New Year from Core Food As per your interest in Core Food, and our role as an arbiter of locally grown good food, I am writing to thank you for making 2015 a very successful year. This past year, while still adhering to our founding principles of local food and strong communities, Core Food was able host a few pop ups and establish a few relationships that saw its vision materialize in very concrete terms. For instance, I spent most of the year working with the members of Washington, DC’s Potter’s House to repurpose the historic space, and revitalize the organization’s food program, which before utilized a “direct-offering approach” to provide food to no and low income folks and their families in the community.  Part of my task involved reorienting the program from this “direct-offering approach” to a “mixed-offering approach,” which seems more sustainable, and ultimately serves the greater interest of the café and community space.

/> A Step Ahead Preschool Request More Information Home About Us Our Program Summer Camp Blog Testimonials Picture Gallery Contact Us The Importance of Early Childhood Education Giving your child the right preschool learning experience can offer long-term advantages throughout his or her educational career. According to The Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) , a preschool education can produce substantial gains in a child’s learning and development, especially in the area of achievement test scores over time.[1] And better achievement test scores mean more opportunities, especially when it comes to college choice and scholarship dollars. The right preschool can make a big difference , not only as your child enters kindergarten, but years down the road. But with all the preschool programs available, choosing the right one can be a challenge. ​ Why A Step Ahead Preschool? At A Step Ahead, our preschool program goal is to produce happy, self-assured learners who are ready to take the next big step on their educational journey. Our students have a 90 percent success rate in reading and math readiness! We work with each child every day they attend thru one-on-one sessions, to develop the skills necessary for reading success when they reach kindergarten. We have a 10:1 student/teacher ratio, so every child gets the individual attention he or she needs to be their very best. “ My son went here, and my daughter goes here now. She always walks into the school looking forward to the activities for the day. Lynn and Ms. Robin are wonderful teachers. They give individual attention to each kid and work with them at their own pace. If you are looking for a preschool then there’s no looking further, A Step Ahead Preschool it is!”  – – Srividhya Govardhanen ​ ​ A Typical Step-Ahead Day We run a full daily schedule focused on your developing preschooler! At A Step Ahead, every child participates in the following activities: Motor skill development Free play/socialization Pledge of Allegiance Circle time- letters and number recognition, music, stories, etc One-on-one time- math and reading skills Arts and crafts Snack time> Outdoor time- weather permitting Fine motor and physical activities- games, puzzles, etc Each and every day at A Step Ahead is all about learning and fun ! ​ “Such a wonderful place to start my daughter on her path of education. Ms. Lynn & Ms. Robin are so caring towards my daughter and all the kids who attend. She could not wait to go to school everyday. Choosing A Step Ahead was one of the best decisions I have made . The one on one caring, safe environment is extremely important to me. When I drop her off I never have to worry.” — Shannon Harrigan Di Somma Our Staff Lead teacher/owner Linda LaRocca brings over 40 years of teaching experience to the Step Ahead classroom.

Executive search (informally called headhunting ) is a specialized recruitment service which organizations pay to seek out and recruit highly qualified candidates for senior-level and executive jobs (e.g., President, Vice-president, CEO). Headhunters may also seek out and recruit other highly specialized and/or skilled positions in organizations for which there is strong competition in the job market for the top talent, such as senior data analysts or computer programmers. The method usually involves commissioning a third-party organization, typically an executive search firm, but possibly a standalone consultant or consulting firm, to research the availability of suitable qualified candidates working for competitors or related businesses or organizations. Having identified a shortlist of qualified candidates who match the client's requirements, the executive search firm may act as an intermediary to contact the individual(s) and see if they might be interested in moving to a new employer. The executive search firm may also carry out initial screening of the candidate, negotiations on remuneration and benefits, and preparing the employment contract. <img src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52d49b0ee4b06cae9d856b24/t/59b9c115c534a5ec8558f095/1505429842986/743+Horizon+Ct+%282%29.jpg"" alt=""Our Practice - Starting in 1999, we have worked exclusively in Medical Affairs and Clinical Development. &nbsp;Our deep network of executives and hiring managers set us apart. &nbsp;Since we have limited the job functions &nbsp;we recruit, we're the specialists that Candidates and Companies can rely on for industry expertise across the US."" /> Our Practice Starting in 1999, we have worked exclusively in Medical Affairs and Clinical Development.  Our deep network of executives and hiring managers set us apart.

When I first met with you I was very depressed concerning situations that had happened to me being sexually harassed on my job. I felt very helpless, worthless and also like I had failed myself, family and basically my life. I also couldn't make decisions and didn't work for over a year and one day I looked online for some help in my area and your name came up on the internet as I searched for it and up appeared you. As we had our sessions I felt better and one day during a session it was like a light came on that I was trying to make every one else happy and I was miserable so we went over a exercise for taking back charge of my life and the power of saying NO and that was a pivotal point that I have kept going forward ever since then. I am so grateful for Dr. Sutherland's practice and also I am an example of his hard work results. I now have a position with a company that takes me all over the United States!

At Total Movement Fitness, we provide a safe, secure environment that removes all judgment.  As the owner, my goal has always been to help anyone who has the desire to change their body.  I have worked with clients who had never stepped foot in to a big box gym because, admittedly, those machines are scary…the sweat everywhere…the runners on the treadmill huffing and puffing…can all be intimidating!  Even as a trainer, I’ve felt the same way. I have had the pleasure of a client texting me at 11pm because she put on a dress that hadn’t been worn in over 2 years.  But to her surprise, she wore it an entire evening – comfortably. I have had the joy of receiving a Facebook post tagging me in a picture of a client who was in a bikini for the first time in her life. I have had tears streaming down my face along with a client who was finally off her blood pressure medication and was able to walk 2 miles without stopping. ​ What I do is so much more than counting reps and sets.  I create personal relationships with every personal training client.  Every workout is personalized for the individual.  Every goal is unique to each person.  It is my responsibility to make sure you feel confident and successful after each and every session; that is how I evaluate success. So if you are looking to gain more confidence, I have group support and accountability programs to help with your achieve your goals. Get ready to get your best body and live your healthiest life ! Using High Intensity Interval Training, a variety of fun Cardio Classes and Strength Training, Total Movement Fitness will help with your weight loss and fitness goals!

Northeast Chiropractic Health Care can help you recover and heal from sports or work related injuries , muscle strains and pulls, back pain and disc troubles, as well as many other ailments. How It All Began Chiropractic care was never intended to treat just aches and pains. The first chiropractic adjustment was made on September 18, 1895 by Dr. Daniel David Palmer on a janitor named Harvey Lillard, who had been deaf for 17 years. He reported losing his hearing after he had been in a cramped position and felt something give in his back. Dr. Palmer adjusted Mr. Lillard and his hearing was restored! Imagine what chiropractic care can do for you! At Northeast Chiropractic Health Care, we are experienced and able to work with all ages. Historically, chiropractic practices were not intended to heal aches and pains, but to better the inner well-being and overall health of an individual.

Better yet, I have mastered the technical hassles of Constant Contact, Facebook, Twitter, Hootsuite, WordPress and more. I take the stress out of building an online presence because I handle its two most nerve-wracking elements: the writing and the platform wrangling . 80% of Small Business Leads Only Convert after 8 to 10 “Touches” Social Posts, Emails and Blog Posts Can Be Those Touches Google tells us that today’s consumer reads 11 pieces of content before making the first call. The good news is that one piece of content can be molded to fit social, email, blog and even marketing automation. Creating a blog post without broadcasting it on the email newsletter and social channels amounts to leaving opportunity locked up in your website. Sharing fun or funny photos on your social channels without writing something up about them for your blog does the same. When you distribute your content via all channels, you: create leads – when the web content writer convinces visitors to call or sign up for your email list. turn your channels (website, social, email and blog) into an automated sales person – that doesn’t ask for time off! increase conversions – when powerful, precise copy flaunts the benefits of your product or service. improve bounce rates – because engaging, entertaining website copywriting keeps readers reading. attract organic links – because a professional web content writer knows what to say to prompt others to link to you. Google views incoming links as endorsements and raises your rank accordingly. As a San Diego web content writer, I’ve worked intensively with Fortune 500 corporations, internet marketing firms, small businesses and professional service providers. Unlike the large content agencies or (heaven forbid!) the offshore content writers, when you work with Informed Web Content, you work with me, Suzanne Delzio. Your copy won’t be passed around from writer to copyeditor to secretary and around the block again. And it won’t be winging its way to India! Call the number above, and I pick up the phone.

It's easy to prep for the entire week and is a great way to get in protein and healthy fat. I used walnuts and grapes in this version but you can also use almonds and apples. It's great on its own, as a topper to a salad or in a wrap as shown here. At 300 calories it packs 40g of protein and only 7 carbs per serving. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed.

You may need to cull it back a bit and be prepared for some soreness and possible nausea or dizziness.

That Is Literally Killing You. Do you feel like your life is falling apart? Stress has been proven to cause many chronic diseases. So, stress is clearly something you want to avoid at all costs; right? The truth is stress is essential for your function, survival and growth. So, how do you engage with the healing stress and avoid the stress that hurts you? The answer is extremely important for your survival. There is also another crucial component to understanding stress. Each and every one of us has an individual threshold of stress that we are able to cope with. If you cross your threshold you will increase the probability of damaging your physiology but if you stay within your threshold you will greatly benefit. The question is, how can you determine your individual limits? The Manual 4 Life Program Our seminar teaches flawlessly and accurately how to detect this breaking point and therefore prevents us from stepping into distress and damaging our physiology. Not understanding is causing us inadvertently to practice self-sabotage daily. If distress is eliminated, we are left with healthy stress that we can use to heal and welcome wellness into our physiology. By understanding and applying the principles in The Manual 4 Life philosophy not only will you greatly decrease your distress you can also increase your efficiency, productivity and happiness. In a one-day seminar Edwardo Rosso, co-author of The Manual 4 Life, will not only guide you to understand stress and how to stay within your threshold but will also teach you how to explore, understand and utilize your own consciousness to achieve confidence, creativity and most of all effectiveness in all areas of your life. This is accomplished by lecture, practice exercises and application to your life events. At the end of the day, you will understand just how simple this philosophy is to apply. It’s so simple an 11 year old can easily use it. Simply enroll in our seminar below, and we take care of the rest! Begin your transformation today!

Today, I went in looking for a belt and bags for an old Kenmore upright, which Sears and another store told me I could no longer get. After being asked 4 or 5 questions, half of which I didn't have answers to, I was handed 2 belts and bags that worked. $17 and I was back in business. No pressure to buy a new vac, just great advice for installation. Thanks again. Next time, I will come to you first.

Lakewood Ranch Chiropractor Dr. Matt Morris focuses on family, both in delivering superior health care to our community and in welcoming you as a part of our practice family. We love getting to know our patients, believing that a deep understanding of their lives and goals will guide us in providing exactly what’s needed for them to live up to their full potential. Most people manage health issues with medication rather than correcting the problem. We find the root cause of people’s health issues so that we can correct the problem at its source with gentle and natural techniques, in order to help them live a healthier and abundant life. A Passion for Pediatrics, Pregnancy and Stressed Parents As a doctor with Epic Pediatrics, Dr. Matt emphasizes the importance of chiropractic care for children . He trains weekly to constantly learn and better serve his youngest patients. Kids with ADHD, sensory processing disorder and autism are especially welcome and see great success through our unique form of chiropractic care. We also see many moms or expecting mothers who are stressed, burned out, fatigued and don’t know where to turn for their own health. We’ll help you and your children discover your true capabilities with natural health care. Unlock Your Full Potential Physical, emotional and toxic forms of stress are everywhere in our world. When present, these types of stress cause an imbalance in the nervous system, which is what your brain uses to communicate with the rest of your body. Chiropractor Lakewood Ranch Dr. Matt is distinguished from other chiropractors by focusing on your body’s nervous system. Your body has an incredible potential for health that is just waiting to be freed. When we balance the sympathetic and parasympathetic modes of your nervous system, you can go from just living to growing, healing and thriving. Contact us today to schedule your appointment! Complimentary consultations can be completed over the phone or in the office so you can find out more about what we may offer you and your children. Chiropractor Lakewood Ranch, Bradenton FL Serving the Lakewood Ranch area of Sarasota and Bradenton TESTIMONIALS See what people have to say Dr. Matt has literally changed the health of our entire family. In the past, when one kid would get sick, our whole family would end up with it. Now our family rarely gets sick! I cannot believe how much better our immune systems are functioning thanks to Dr. Matt. - Christina I have struggled with weekly to sometimes daily headaches for over 15 years. After a couple of visits, I was headache free and have been headache free since! Dr. Morris is a Life Saver! - Kathy I couldn’t believe how gentle Dr. Matt and his adjustments were. I was fearful of having my neck cracked and am thrilled to have found a chiropractor who doesn’t do that! - Amanda We took our daughter to see Dr. Matt after meeting him at an event. She had speech development issues. We were a little skeptical if chiropractic could help her. After the consultation and exam we knew we were in the right place! She went from saying 4 or 5 words to saying 15 or more different words within a few weeks! We can’t thank Dr. Matt enough! - Angie Dr. Morris is very professional and truly cares for his patients. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to get their health back! - Jessica Our son was scheduled to have tubes put in his ears due to chronic ear infections. We were afraid to go the surgery route and a friend told us about Dr. Matt and how he could help. Not only did our son avoid surgery, but he has also been ear infection free since beginning care. - Tony GET IN TOUCH WITH US TODAY (941) 822-8828 Email Pinnacle Chiropractic Comments, Requests, Questions, or Suggestions First Name Last Name Respond to me via: Email Phone No Response Email Address Phone Number Leave this empty: Send Message Request Appointment (pending confirmation) Patient Type New Patient Current Patient Returning Patient First Name Last Name Email Address Phone Number Respond to me via: Email Phone Preferred Day/Time: Date Appointment Hour H 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Appointment Minute M 00 15 30 45 AM or PM AM PM Comments or Questions Leave this empty: Send Message Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on GooglePlus Share via Email Request Appointment Email Us Pinnacle Chiropractic 8450 Cooper Creek Blvd., Suite 104 University Park , FL 34201 Phone: (941) 822-8828 Copyright Legal Privacy Sitemap Lakewood Ranch Chiropractor Chiropractor Website by Perfect Patients.",Health and Fitness

Attorney and Legal Services At Tiffany Sullivan Attorney at Law, we help you with issues concerning general civil litigation. While most of our work involves cases in Santa Rosa and Escambia counties, we are able to represent clients throughout Florida and other states. What is Litigation? Litigation is the term typically used to describe all the legal steps involved in settling a controversy between two or more parties before, during, and after the actual trial for either civil or criminal cases. We represent and advise clients in an effort to prevent disputes which lead to litigation. However, when litigation becomes inevitable, we are prepared and experienced. Experience In Estate Planning Contracts Transactional Law Business Entity What is Civil Law? Civil law relates to the relationships of contract and exchange between private parties (individuals, businesses, or individuals and businesses), such as marriage, divorce, buying and selling property, contracts, and warranties, etc. Civil law encompasses all law that is not criminal law. Rather than being tried in a criminal court and a criminal conviction and sentence being imposed, civil law cases are litigated in civil courts as lawsuits and the end result is normally financial compensation. What is a Civil Lawsuit? A civil lawsuit is a private suit between two or more entities (and can involve individual persons, businesses, or government entities) that generally involves infringement upon the rights and protections of individuals. Civil offenses (such as torts or breaches of contract) can vary greatly and include offenses ranging from a breach of contract or warranty, the unlawful taking of property, invasion of privacy, negligence, or intentional and unintentional infliction of physical injury or emotional distress.
